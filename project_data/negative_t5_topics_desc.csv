this is my first time confessing to someone and truly admiring them  i was    when i met her we were in the same batch at college  we started talking through messenger occasionally  helping each other with our studies  eventually  i developed feelings for her  even though we were mostly wearing masks due to covid  so i didn t have a clear visual of her face  despite that  i still liked her   when the pandemic started to ease  and masks were no longer mandatory  i saw her face for the first time during a video project  she was  without a doubt  the most beautiful person i had ever seen in person  she had eyeglasses  hazel brown eyes  thin eyebrows  and thin red lips  she was stunning   after finishing our first year of college  i decided to confess my feelings to her  she responded with a genuine thank you but didn t share the same feelings  despite this  we continued chatting as usual  and over time  our bond grew closer  however  she eventually sent me a message  saying she didn t want to give me false hope and that we could still be good friends  although it was difficult  i accepted her rejection because it felt like the right thing to do   a few days later  she messaged me on instagram  asking for help with a project  which i gladly did  we were both studying engineering not the smartest in the room  but capable  we started talking again  but after a few months  i noticed she had unfollowed me on instagram  confused  i asked her if i had done something wrong  she claimed she hadn t unfollowed me and didn t remember doing so  my friends told me it wasn t possible for instagram to just unfollow someone randomly  which made me suspect she wasn t being entirely honest   social media isn t something i m into i only got into it because of college and her  so i m not familiar with its features  anyway  i didn t dwell on it too much until she deleted her instagram account and later deactivated her facebook and messenger accounts during our second year of college  around christmas time  i sent her a merry christmas message  but she didn t respond until after new year s  once she reactivated her accounts  except for instagram    we continued talking and helping each other out  once  she asked if i was going to school because she was paying her tuition  and i said yes since i was doing the same  i then asked if she wanted to join me at the mall  and she agreed  i took her to burger king  which i later found out was her favorite fast food  she didn t have money to eat there  so i treated her  as it felt like the right thing to do   we spent the day getting to know each other better  and it felt worth it despite the initial awkwardness  over time  we hung out more frequently at different malls  studying together at coffee shops  where i did my best to help her  even though i wasn t the smartest  eventually  she invited me to hang out in her city  which i was thrilled about since i d never been there before  she even helped me with directions   during our study sessions  she confided in me that she wasn t happy with her exam results and just wanted to have fun instead of being with her friends  we ended up ice skating  eating at her favorite places  and genuinely having a good time  it made me think she was giving me a chance   but then  during our final exams  she told me she only saw me as a friend and nothing more  she compared me to a guy friend of hers  and it hurt me deeply  i confronted her  asking if there was someone else she was waiting for  but she said no  i was the only one pursuing her  she explained that she wasn t ready for a relationship and might not be until the future if ever  i accepted her words and continued being her friend   a few days later  we went out to eat  and during our conversation  i opened up about my past  including my mom s passing  which had traumatized me  she mentioned that i might have an anxious attachment style  which i hadn t known about before  she said she had an avoidant attachment style  so i researched it and realized she truly was avoidant  understanding this helped me process her rejections better  and i adjusted my behavior to avoid triggering her avoidant tendencies   we continued hanging out during the summer break  and she even made plans for us to go on a vacation together  she also suggested joining me for window shopping  which felt a bit strange but nice  she joked about deactivating her social media again  which i didn t like because it made me sad  but she knew that  despite this  she didn t deactivate her accounts  and we kept talking and hanging out   she treated me sometimes  which i appreciated  she even bought me a phone case after noticing mine was broken  choosing green because it was my favorite color  she ended up getting a new phone that was also green  which matched mine  and we both found it cute   we both passed our second year of college  and during the summer vacation  we kept hanging out regularly  but then  out of nowhere  she sent me a message rejecting me for the third time  this left me feeling even more confused  after everything we d been through the time we spent together  the things we did for each other  the conversations we had i couldn t understand why she would reject me again  i never made any romantic gestures  only complimented her  supported her  and gave her space  yet  she rejected me   i asked her once more if there was someone else or if she was waiting for someone  she said no  then i asked if she could wait for me  and she jokingly replied   why should i wait for you   i told her that after college  i would pursue her officially because i d have my own money to spend  she said no  that she didn t plan to be with me in the future  which broke me  she added that she d be happy if i found someone who could reciprocate my feelings  but i told her there was no one else but her  she laughed it off  but despite all of this  she still talks to me   i asked her to give me a chance  and she did  but things changed  she became cold and distant  although sometimes she still showed affection  like remembering my favorite pastries or drinks  we still hung out  and she even insisted on joining me at the mall when she was bored  but the warmth was gone  she still wears the hoodie i picked out for her  and i still use the phone case she bought for me   now  i m wondering if i should continue pursuing her or if it s time to move on  i feel like her avoidant attachment style is preventing her from expressing how she really feels  she is probably self sabotaging the relationship  i have a lot of patience when it comes to this  but i m confused about what to do next  i still love her not just because of her looks  but because of who she is and where she came from  i understand her sad history  but i don t know what to do  any advice ;31_told_relationship_didn_friend;1.0
 first of all  i m doing this somewhat begrudgingly  because i don t want ppl to  play    pay for pve  it s not that i don t want you to enjoy the game  quite the opposite  i just don t think bsg deserves a single penny for they lazy and incompetent implementation of pve  if you got access thru eod   unheard already  by all means  go have fun  but please don t buy it separately  they did not do a good job with it  tarkov is a great game in general  so of course it can still be fun considering the basic framework is fine  but specifically as a dedicated pve experience  it sucks  ai is    dynamic  repetitive and poses no real cheese free challenge once you understand how they work  they are either braindead or frustrating  with hardly anything in between    long loading times  shortened raid times  no offline play and no mod support     way to go bsg  way to go     now  rant over  to the actual content   you really have to learn about the specific ways tarkov bots work  they aren t very hard once you understand them  but i know they can feel crazy tough   daunting when you re new to it all     so here s a few tips to hopefully make it easier to deal with the ai       the ai usually knows when you scope in on them  so better be prepared   they usually aim for limbs  so always bring cms   surv kits   they can sometimes track you through but bushes   cover  make sure you have good cover before you engage or make sure you can quickly get to solid cover once they are aggo ed   they can see you from very far away  especially raiders and pmcs   they re practically blind at night after around   m  if you have nvgs  maps like lighthouse become a cakewalk   pmcs   raiders have aimlock   laser aim  you can t out aim them  it s kill first or be killed        never never never re peak the same angle in the first       seconds  they will just kill you  i m serious  if you must  wait       seconds  they will have disengaged their aimbot after some time  this takes some discipline and getting used to  but don t think you can just quickly get rid of them from the same corner  wait or reposition        they don t really have flinch or get aim punched  they ll just keep blasting you  so you either have to kill them immediately or switch angles   positions  don t keep firing  especially center mass with bad ammo and expect them to no return fire  they will and you regret it    if you want to know where they are exactly  use your voicelines  i feel like many ppl don t know that both scavs  less consistent  and raiders   ai pmcs will consistently answer to your voicelines  making it much easier to pinpoint their location    pmcs   raiders will often aggressively push you once you engage them  so consider your location well  if you re is a small room with just one door let s say  and you only have    round mags  and   ai charge at you  better make sure you have good ammo and good aim or it ll be back to main menu in no time  they can also bug and shoot through closed doors  so don t feel safe just because you closed the door    generally  bring some sort of magnification  more ammo  more meds  bigger mags are a life saver  don t use pump action shotguns  if sniping  bring a sidearm  learn about ammo and penetration  so you don t have to wonder why the scav wearing armor you just tried blasting center mass with shitty ammo suddenly blasts your head off     from comments   scavs often keeps spawning in seemingly endless waves in pve  at the very least you should be ready to fight a lot of them  especially if you want to take it slow   don t know how to quest super quickly   efficiently  bring as much ammo as you can   hope that helps  if you can think of anything else  post it in the comments  i ll add it to the list ;escape_tarkow;0.1287411853776743
i m going to give my tldr of the slapfights in the subreddit     nixos   url  is an open source os that many people volunteer their free time to build     anduril   url  makes autonomous ai drones to kill people using nixos  they have also hired multiple community members to do so   there s larger drama that spills outside of reddit on this but the tldr is anduril is sponsoring nixcon an in person convention about nixos  and people aren t too happy about it  a detailed explanation of the community drama can be found  here   url  if you care   this culminated in one of the community members and anduril employees receiving a temporary suspension to the project  the primary reason as i can surmise is because they were kind of a jerk about being against gender minority representation in leadership   drama thread    employee of anduril gets a temporary suspension from the nixos project  turns to the subreddit to say goodbye    url     goodbye  you have made yourself difficult to be missed      thanks derpface        no problem  your username remind me of someone who is directly complicit in creating tools used in a genocide  and who actively concern trolls about minorities  cannot think of his name for the life of me  though    link   url       after some digging  it appears that the root of this is that nix maintainers are limiting the involvement of people who work for defense companies  read  weapons manufacturers               why would that be reasonable  those people make weapons that keep you safe  you d be the first in the corner in a puddle of piss and years of you were invaded because your country didn t have proper  weapons  to protect you        those weapons killed my innocent family members    young girls who never hurt a fly in a war that probably happened before you knew how to type    link   url    hope you slip and fall into an unassuming volcano  or something equally awful   	thanks   link   url    you did your best to prevent any constructive discussions and successfully failed to show any growth or sympathy      errmmmm ackshyually you are the one stifling constructive discussion good sir  constructive discussion is when we never listen to minorities of any kind   link   url    to be fair you lost me when you called the need for minority representation  discrimination   again and again  like    times in the same thread  you failed to acknowledge the power dynamics at place  and how a  non political  stance just hurts us by default  and what s worse you just dismissed the need to hold a wider conversation on the basis of your own feelings about privilege and discrimination  while ignoring what people were telling you repeatedly  edit  see  that s why we just leave these spaces  fuck the alt right and everyone who classifies ethnic and sexual minorities as  political   you ruin good spaces with your toxic waste of ideologies     i m an anarchist libertarian  barefoot in the garden  ecology loving homestead veteran hippie  with a decent sized lgbtq  friend group since i live near seattle  they are good people if it weren t for the fact that most of them are lawyers    link   url   drama thread    clarification on why guy from thread   was suspended   url    disgusting  labeling a man based on an idea that would ve been logical pre       so much hearsay and putting words into his mouth  dei needs to go away  as it is a plague of exclusion and oppression olympics  it has no place in a free society  it has no place in open source  it s cultural shift with good intentions but naviagted terribly  nix  this is just wrong and your hearing the man but not listening    link   url     is this about the project excluding defense companies  if so that doesn t make sense to me  open source should just be tools and allow anyone to contribute      it s about control over nix  and the defense sponsor was just the issue being seized upon           link   url     if you label me as a  racist fascist bigot   then anything i say is malicious      you ve been posting like this a lot over the last couple days  this attitude indicates to me that you are not actually planning on changing anything about your behavior  and you don t actually take any criticism levied against you seriously  you simply frame it as a ridiculous caricature that can be discarded and ignored  so the whole  i take full responsibility  thing rings fairly hollow        who the fuck cares  stop trying to wrangle out some kind of twisted confession  we have churches and preachers to do that  he s a volunteer    he doesn t owe you anything when are you going to stop being obnoxious    link   url   drama thread    multiple community members quit the project  some because of the ai drone strike thing  some because guy from thread   got banned    url    i for one support lgbtq inclusion in autonomous murder drone manufacturing  it ll fix both issues    link   url    that s great  i don t disagree in principle  but what are we going to do about all the people leaving over this  though  a significant maintainer just left over the anduril sponsorship fiasco  and over a dozen others have followed him  i think this deserves some airtime and discussion      thats great  but what are we going to do when the unchecked mod team banned everyone that contributes and doesnt share their opinion  they clearly shift the allowed debate in their favor  this allows them to shape this project after their own liking  this deserves some discussion  but the mod blatantly flag or ban every critic they see  there is no healthy or solution oriented debate to be had under those conditions    link   url      the thought of any of my work contributing to someone s death by drone makes me feel physically ill  this can be said about almost any open source contribution    in fact  it can be said if you pay taxes in almost any well developed nation  that uses drones to defend itself   a    k per year sponsorship is pocket change  but heck  you can even think that s    k they have less to spend on drone parts    link   url    why not try to be apolitical  for example here  used for horrific things   people have morals     horrific things  arent absolutist  you are saying horrific people with morals means  that their side side is the good one that isnt absolutist     if you take money from everyone  how not take it from one company could be political  or at least less than not take it     i would agree that isnt good argument  but not absolutist  you can still be against it  protest against  work against it etc  if he said for example  in fact  it can be said if you pay taxes in almost any well developed nation  that uses drones to defend itself   so why try   i would agree with you    link   url ;23_people_facebook_fake_post;0.12376800135312913
   the context      a user posts a screenshot of a tweet of an ai enhanced image of   url  ella purnell s backside to  r facepalm  the image in question is a promo image from the new fallout television series in which she stars  the implication of the tweet is that her ass is not big enough for the user s liking  oop calls this tweet  peak incel behavior    the sub quickly starts to question the definition of the word incel  if this is actually inappropriate  and if a redditor s girlfriend is imaginary        the drama        one user sees no problem      there is nothing wrong with liking bigger asses  there is  however  something wrong when you go around editing an image of an actress because  her flatness bothered you enough  not every depiction of women has to pander to the male gaze and be overtly sexual  if you don t see what s wrong with this person s behaviour  then i don t know what to tell you buddy    url      this is deplorable behavior  of course  but words have meaning  and so do superlatives  if that s the worst kind of incel for you  the worst kind of behavior you can imagine     well you must have a very peaceful life and that s cool for you  but you d have to discover the real world     the answer is  there is nothing inherently wrong with editing an image  in poor taste  maybe  but a pretty insignificant offense  it s not like the dude is campaigning to have her kicked off the show for having a flat ass       this smacks of hysterical reaching for the sake of being upset and just causes unnecessary noise       also it was probably a reference to the video game  in which the suit is similar to the one on the right  and also it winked to the fact that the game has as always a lot of  perfect  body        yeah  i just assumed it was something from the game  people just need to clutch their pearls about something         the hashtag state clearly they are putting the series and the game in comparison  also the body type  waist up  of the actress is slightly changed to better resemble the body type of the female playable character in the series     continued       they don t state that clearly  you are just apologist            maybe it was a joke  maybe you didn t get it or it was in poor taste  either way stop being a puritan  live and let live  what it looks like to me is a referential joke to how the bubble butt is one of the first mods made for bethesda games almost every time after a ui fix      or maybe you could take two seconds to check out their profile and see that their entire twitter account is committed to using ai to overly sexualise  woke  female character designs  this is a    year old man getting angry whenever a female character is not presented as a sex symbol and using ai to  fix  this  issue       i am not saying he is the next hitler for doing what he does  all i am saying is that this is peak incel behaviour       i never understand why people describe these people as angry    bro  they horny not angry  just wait until you find out about fan fiction    all those evil    year old incel women sexualising random characters from films  how dare they         people are sexual deviants  and whether it s through thinking  writing  pictures  cartoons  etc  people will sexualise anything       nah  i doubt you ve ever seen peak incel behavior  you find that in the army or playing a civil war sim  you find that when someone plays imperial guard in warhammer generalizations as a joke   those dudes really hate women and the way they view them is unhinged and downright scary  this is more likely someone trolling you  it s working      is a user s girlfriend fake      idk if it s incem behavior to like juicy booties  my girlfriend pays more attention to ass than i do    url      there can be female incels and they can find partners       the word incel and finding a partner seem to be in conflict with each other lol       eh it happens  you can have the mindset and not be single  there are such things as toxic relationships         or in my case my girlfriend works out so she pays more attention to woman s bodies and has goals she wants to reach and a juicy booty is one of them  people like booty     continued       is she canadian      if canadian is a code word for black then yes  if not then no       it s a code word for imaginary  sorry  i ll stop  just look up the exception that proves the rule       anatomy is discussed      to be fair most women have some ass  and would not be flat in a jumpsuit  so it s more unrealistic to make her flat  i don t know why people really care  it s just a mod  i don t see anything wrong with altering a character to fit your own sinceabilities  fan fiction and art does that all the time  and no one hates on that    url      this isn t a game  this is a real actor in a suit  they didn t  make her flat  that s her wearing clothing  tf are you talking about      altering a real human to fit your  sinceabilities   sensibilities  when it s just making her ass bigger and in skin tight bottoms of a jumpsuit that don t match the top is just incel behaviour       quiet  i clearly didn t know this was a person  why do they have person advertising fallout        then why did you feel so confident to say what you did         cause people complain all the time  about sexualizing female video games characters  i thought that s what this was  and they were making fun of a fan for drawing moding the vault dweller like this wasn t sure if it was a mod or art      continued        wasn t sure if it was a mod or art    again  why did you feel confident to say what you said if you couldn t take two seconds to look it up  it s a rhetorical question  i m not actually asking you  i m telling you it s better to just keep your mouth shut when you re not sure      cause i can t just google fallout fan art and expect to find this  there s tons of it and that s what i thought this was       but you can just  not comment  right  or can you literally not help yourself        why would not comment  i have no reason not to  i can t know i m wrong beforehand  also i originally seen this post in gamingcirclejerk  now i m really confused cause this has nothing to do with the game  so why is it there         so you physically can t help yourself from commenting  even when you have no idea what you re talking about  maybe that s why you have issues having normal conversations with people     continued       no  that not what i said i have no reason to stop myself  cause i thought i did know  it s not like i would think i have no idea on something and then comment on it  i thought it was about something i did know what i was talking about      but you didn t know  and you didn t know that you didn t know  and you likely don t know a lot of things  but for some reason you don t think to make sure you know what you re talking about when you talk  i m telling you  if you stfu a lot more your life will get better       yeah but i can t know i didn t  know  till i find out  i mean if i never made this comment i never would have known        sure you can  going forward just assume that you don t know anything because you obviously don t  or just keep complaining that you can t have a normal conversation because you rush in headfirst without knowing anything  keep arguing  it s totally getting you somewhere         well then i just wouldn t speak ever  that s worse for me  if i have to choose between it just being my problem  and making everyone else s problem too i would much rather do that  if it s everyone else s problem it s also their responsibility to fix it     continued       i m sure your life will work out just great with that mentality  good luck      insults are made      this is a real person who s photo has been edited you absolute chud   url      hey fuckface  why do you assume everyone would know this  only fallout material i ve ever heard of is the games       i don t see why that s relevant  given the context of your comment         porn brain damage is real        it clearly does  cause if a fan is making content for a game they like  they tend to make what they like           literally brain damaged individual        that s also not relevant because my point was about your original comment  considering balloon butt more realistic than the actual picture of a real person  but yea thanks for proving my point cumbrain     continued       but you said in the context of my comment not mine and your comment  if we are just talking about the context of my comment i didn t know that was a person  words mean things when you put them in a certain order  honey  i know that s hard for you       words mean things when you put them in a certain order       when i do yeah  but apparently not for you jesus      jokes are made      nah just peak male ingenuity edit  it s a joke  if you downvote karma s gonna get you   url      that is an low bar  like if the best you can imagine achieveing with your life is a photoshopped butt you may as well just wander into traffic  ctrl c ctrl v is not that difficult       hell this is an ai prompt so its not even that much work  its  comptar maek butt  and some script sighs and gives the monkey a pixel       yeah  i m sorry you thought i was serious  i was exaggerating         so much for humor        everyone has their own talents  im sure youre good at like  eating muffins or something  dont sweat it ill be funny for you       the real low bar is expecting that it s socially acceptable to suggest suicide       wait how many times are you gonna respond to one post here chief  admission limit    pick a lane      is any of this real      you know it s all virtual  right  edit for example  negative comments about paparazzi pictures of scarlet johansson were wild  there s nothing wrong with the way she looks  however  costume designers will make artistic decisions about a character s clothes  it might be polarising  but in the end  it s all virtual  people will always have something to complain about    url      uh no  that actress is a real person       because actors just get out of the shower and put on their everyday clothes to go on set        i really don t see your argument  just because she s currently doing her job means she can t possibly be depicted the way a normal human would look         the whole argument seems like a storm in a teacup     continued       i couldn t give less of a damn about whether or not it s important  i just want to know what you re arguing      check my edit  either way the costume designer goes  there will always be someone who complains       colour me surprised       so your argument is that because someone would always complain  the guy in the post is perfectly justified in playing with this woman s image like a doll  am i getting this right        no  but there s no use in getting nickers in a twist over guys like this         then what  is  your argument  clearly i m confused             you know that s a real photo of a real human actress on the left  right       on a film set        incel behavior exhibit a        because having an anime avatar is so grown up             because you didn t jump to personal insults     incel behavior exhibit a     not an insult when it s true       so tell me about your childhood  is rejection something that you are afraid of        lol case in point  you be good now         you keep mentioning things that you describe as being embarrassing  is there something we should know

i want to preface this by saying i don t think the software engineering fellowship is  entirely  a scam  there are projects  there are moderators in our discord helping people get situated  etc  but my gosh  this is a total train wreck   yes  it s free    yes  it is  something  to put on your resume  however  this environment is absolute chaos  the program itself is disorganized  the co founders have some red flag behavior  and communication down right sucks       let s start off with the fact that        people applied and they accepted almost        people  imagine  half  of those people in a single discord  bombarding all the chats with questions because most of us have no idea what s going on  we receive information  like schedules  zoom links  at the last minute  and when we do receive that information  it s incredibly broad and you come to accept that you re going to be confused for the next   weeks    now  onto today  the day we were supposed to attend a kick off meeting  typically the co founders will drop the link to the zoom call in the  announcements channel  i was waiting  and waiting  and waiting for the link to drop  nothing  i was at least an hour early  at my desk  plugged in and ready to click    not today  apparently  the link was sent by email  unless there is another place that i d say     of us aren t aware of   i received the link minutes after the meeting was supposed to start  and when i tried to join  the zoom call maxed out in attendance    why would you press the importance of attending the kick off meeting  accept        people  and only make it possible for       people to attend   but wait  it gets better  co founder yasin posts this in the announcements channel afterwards   we capped zoom to       this was by choice for a few reasons  people who show up early will usually benefit earlier  usually the people who apply early to jobs have a bigger advantage esp for f    companies  this will be the easiest route for most to get a job           ah  yes  let s gaslight all the people who couldn t get into the zoom call because headstarter couldn t send a link on time  you want to see who shows up early  send the link early  let people show up    minutes early and stop accepting guests right when it starts  honestly  it s big big red flag behavior  there s clearly a lack of organization or preparation on the founders  end  and instead they blamed it on fellows and made it sound like they did it on purpose   let s also talk about the dashboard   i ve been on the dashboard to see what i m supposed to work on for the week and the due dates keep changing  right before my eyes  the day we re supposed to start working on our projects  the due dates change  the order changes  and some things are being completely removed from it    and then the co founders are so quick to post about all the cool things they did on linkedin  i get it  i too post things i m proud of on linkedin  but it feels inauthentic while        of us couldn t even join the kick off meeting        it feels a lot like appearances    but also   i m  here for appearances  i just didn t think this fellowship would be as messy as it is  i was really excited and ready to go  i also wasn t expecting to see unaccountable ceo tech behavior right out the gate    don t get me wrong  i m still participating  game recognizes game  this just might be a very different   weeks than i was planning       wish me luck  y all  ;48_account_email_scam_outlier;1.0
  tl dr  it s likely a scam and will not contribute to your resume     after looking through various reddit posts  and attending their on boarding meeting  i strongly believe that the internship is a scam  when i looked them up to check if they were legit  all i saw were various radicalai websites and podcasts  but nothing that convinced me of their legitimacy  this company seems to be constantly changing its operations and its  lab fee   for me  the lab fee was       every month for   months   with the option to stay longer if i wanted  they said that the code is open source  but never provided any links  also  i would start the next upcoming monday   first  they sent me an email with a google meet invite for the onboarding process  then they sent an email of the slides that they read from during the meeting  they had this bizarre collaboration video game space where your character walked into  rooms  to talk with others  the two presenters were michael berliner  the coo  and someone i couldn t find the name of on their website  the other presenter said that when she attended what she believed was a feedback session with berliner it was a job interview and he offered her a job  which struck me as very weird  this person also said that their background is in neuroscience for some reason  berliner said that it is fine if the person has no experience with the languages used because they can spend their time learning  at the end of their presentation  they had a  q a session  that ignored raised hands and ended in    seconds   i don t want to post any links they sent me because i don t want any trouble from them   most of these posts speak to how disorganized and unuseful the experience is  no one has come forward to say otherwise     url     url     url           this is the most in depth post            url ;48_account_email_scam_outlier;1.0

when ai was first introduced  the internet was free to be scraped  even though scraping was a legal grey area  it was done in order to create the first successful ai chatbots  we memed about how the internet was being sold back to us at a subscription cost  it was a closed and proprietary system feeding off of public data      before ai  no one made a post realizing it would make its way into a training set  no one posted a video thinking it would be used to train sora  and when ai become successful  few questioned whether or not this was okay  thankfully  artists have been the first to see a danger in ai  and they pull back their best work  but is that the internet we want      with the advent of social media  we became privacy conscious  but social media became the spice of the internet  and we decided to overlook the fact that we did not have much control over our data  who cares if google can read all of our emails  who cares if facebook can read our dms  even when mark zuckerberg s controversial remark became public  we continued to give him our data   they trust me   dumb fucks       years later  public email protocols are still being used  and now facebook has turned meta  hoping to collect much metadata and grab you by the eyeballs  to paraphrase the joker   no one bats an eye       i remember in high school  when weed was illegal  i showed a picture of a bong i had just purchased to a friend through a facebook dm  and one day  the cops came to my door because my brother had gotten in trouble  seeing me  the cop said   i have a picture of you holding a bong   social services were called  and in my living room  the lady said   anything you post on the internet is there forever   my trust in facebook was destroyed  i could not believe that law enforcement somehow had access to my facebook dms  when facebook locked me out of my account asking for a photo of my government id to regain control  i deleted my account instead  hide yo kids  hide yo wife      we as westerners worry about social credit scores  but in reality  these systems are probably already being built secretly without the public being aware      i think we have fallen asleep to privacy discussions we used to have back in the early days of social media  now with the advent of ai  i feel that we need to have these discussions again      one day ai will be ubiquitous  it s too convenient not to be  we will all have access to jarvis  students will use it to accelerate their learning  businesses will use it to build and serve  people will use it for journaling  telling it all their personal information  and it will be therapeutic  pointing out connections you were unable to make  it will manage your busy life  reminding you of upcoming events and appointments  where is the irony here  is it that ai meant to give us freedom will control us  or is it that social media was meant to connect us  but we will all talk to ai instead      in the dark knight  when bruce wayne reveals the mass surveillance system to lucius fox  who is played by morgan freeman  known for being the voice of god  he remarks   this is wrong   bruce says it s necessary to catch the joker  reminding us of the argument that mass surveillance protects us  lucius replies   as long as this machine is at wayne enterprises  i won t be       having tried ai  and seeing it s potential for privacy abuse  i agree with lucius  sentiment  so i will be working toward creating privacy focused alternatives to proprietary ai chat systems  i hope you see the danger  too      he who controls the spice controls the universe       url ;23_people_facebook_fake_post;0.14445434094048812
 his is long bear with me and yes i m looking for advice but also someone told me i was an asshole for involving my daughter in my new relationship  i don t see how but i m trying to see if this is why my ex wife won t let me talk to my daughter    advice and criticism is welcome please   anyways  my age     ex wife lacey fake name age     has completely cut off all contact with me and our daughter sam     after my gf becca announced our pregnancy and our engagement which sam was a part of on facebook  and i want to know how do i still keep in contact with sam as she calls me dad and we are really close  she absolutely loves becca so i don t see where there is a problem    for context  here s the history   me and lacey met in college  i was a biology engineer major and she was a music major  sam was   at the time  we hit it off and got married when she graduated when sam was six  things came to head when i said i wanted more kids one day and lacey agreed saying she always wanted a big family for sam  so we spent a few months   trying and when we succeeded  lacey came to me with second thoughts saying she didn t want anymore kids as she was just happy with sam and she wanted to get rid of them  i told her i understood  i will admit i was hurt  confused and a huge part of my died knowing she was going to murder our baby   a baby we agreed on but i got she was three years younger than me and a baby is a lot of responsibility  all the same  i told her that we needed to go our separate ways if she felt that way  i don t know how she took it and nor do i care at this point in my life  she went ahead with abortion  i nursed her back to health and i got a lawyer with divorce papers   i served them to her a month after the abortion and lacey was pissed  she called me every name under the book and how i should have fought her more   i honestly didn t see the point  i would have been a bigot and resented anyways  eventually we came to agreement with sam     we would split custody with her since i was the only father figure she knew    a year later with the divorce finalized  after spending time with a mutual friend of our mtg friend group  i met becca playing dnd  becca was pregnant at the time and she is    years younger than me so whatever attraction i felt towards her  i put it off for a while till we all went on a prolonged tripped to the rennfaire  i nervously asked her out and she accepted   the rest was history  i was there when she gave birth three months later to rod    and he is my son as much as sam is my daughter   sam has met becca multiple times with lacey s permission ofcourse and those two often times are encased in their own little world with little rod as their high glorious king as they call him  it s been two years of dating becca and we just found out that she s pregnant with twins  sam and i were excited   plus we ve been trying to throw a massive party for becca as a surprise as i want to propose to her    well   we did last week and it was amazing   sam did so many of the decorations by hand and even painted a mural of her  becca and rod in one of their fantasy settings they play    one of the rare times that becca had posted anything on her facebook however she excluded both rod and sam s pictures from her post as she doesn t believe in posting kids on social media she says there s too many pedophiles and it s too easy to get pictures of kids without getting caught  i just support her really and sam appreciates it     a few hours into the party  lacey called me and demanded i bring sam home  i agreed after some small back and forth that it was my weekend and sam didn t want to go  sam was in tears when i told her i had to take her home  becca comforted her the best she could and cut her cake early to help out    but long story short  when i took sam back home lacey through every cuss word at me she could  her brother and father was there yelling at me about not prioritizing sam  sam got involved with the yelling screaming she hated it there and that she d rather live with me and becca and rod causing me to literally getting shoved out the house and told i could never see sam again    sorry this is so long but i thought i d add this so i can get better advice  how do i go about this   besides me becca is really missing sam and rod keeps looking for her in her room  while we do have her stuff packed so we can move into a bigger house it was supposed to be a surprise for sam as becca found a house with a room in the attic that can double as a loft bedroom so as sam ages she can have her own space if she chooses too and her own bathroom   we bought it already     so any advice on how to get our daughter back  and because i talked to a few people  someone called me the asshole for undermining lacey but i never did  i always always asked for permission except for sam helping with the engagement and celebration of becca being pregnant with twins  i didnt thinking had

long read i apologize please tell me if im crazy for feeling upset and hurt    my boyfriend   m and i   f  need advice  so the situation starts on easter  i took shrooms at my best friend of    years gma house  i asked him if he wanted to come but he said he was okay and didn t mind  they ve met and hung out numerous times  i met her in elementary school  while i was at this easter thing  her cousin asked if we wanted to take shrooms  seeing as ive never taken them before  i said yes  easter was fun but i ended up coming home early  i was worried that since he spent easter alone that he possibly might have cheated on me  and i was just freaking out  it wasn t a bad trip but every thought i had my brain would just think of every bad case scenario that could happen  when i got home i cuddle and love up on him like usual  the bad thoughts disappear  however  he falls asleep before me and as im laying on his chest i see he like hid his phone  and i needed to see if he was texting other people or not  i go onto his phone and see that he was using the waifu app to sext ai bots  and he had multiple chats and he had spent two  hours on it on screen time  i read the chats and they were so sexual and i just felt like complete shit  his chats and socials were completely clean  almost too clean he had deleted old texts and call logs of his ex but i didn t care about that  i cared about the fact he told me he doesn t watch porn or anything like that  but then proceeds to text ai  when i woke up i told him that the shrooms kinda influenced me to go thru his phone and i saw the ai chats  he was embarrassed and said he wouldn t do it anymore  i explained he could sext me that way and i would respond similarly   i used to write smut and also i have a high sex drive myself  instead of having to use robots  i thought the conversation went well     so fast forward multiple weeks later  one night  i will admit i am in the wrong here  but we were at a friends house and she had started going thru her boyfriends phone without asking  i was completely wasted and thought that was so crazy  so then she made the comment  have him give you his phone  and so i looked at him and he said  i don t have my phone on me it s on the other room   this raised red flags in our head tbh  i frowned and he didn t bother getting up to grab it or anything  and i didn t want to get up to grab it in fear of being desperate  so  i leave it be however my friend is dead set on getting to the bottom of it  so the boys  her bf and then my bf  wanted mcdonald s so we left and when we left she had me take his phone without asking  mcdonald s was only a   minute drive so we wouldn t be gone that long  i turned his location off that way he wouldn t get notified that we had taken his phone  i go thru it and he everyday almost spends     minutes on the waifu app  he never stopped  he continued to use the app that i vocalized what a boundary for me  this crushed me because he would do it on days we had sex and ultimately i felt like i didn t please him enough  we make an excuse that he left it in the car  we come back with food  and all is okay ish  i don t say anything about it until we get back to our apartment  i was like  i saw you texting on the waifu app again  and he said he d immediately delete it and that he was super sorry  i felt bad for making it a big deal but he told me he doesn t watch porn or masturbate when in a relationship  so  if he wouldn t have said that i probably wouldn t have been so upset about discovering it  but to know in the past he held that view and that i randomly changed it for some reason just hurts a lot    fast forward to today he now uses character ai  which he logs out of so i can t even login or see what s said  and snapchat ai  after expressing how much i don t like it  he continues to do it  am i the asshole for telling him he can t sext ai when in a relationship with me  ;31_told_relationship_didn_friend;0.33232564589786406

 okay so i can t edit title  but what i mean is that the ai rarely actually seems to play the game well      so this is a list  off the top of my head  of problems the ai has that make them play weaker and weaker every patch  this has nothing to do with actual battle difficulty  but rather their weakness in creating strong empires capable of putting out strong armies         build their settlements really stupidly  spend their money on walls and stupid buildings instead of having a template for how to build like a normal person  has the following issues     often unable to build high tier units   often unable to get new powercreeped dlc units   often unable to build an actual army composition since they have     high tier recruit buildings at best  anyone ever see the famed    giants stack          often don t even use their faction s special abilities  or don t use them intelligently     skeven spam  menace from below  at the start of battle  before battle lines have even met  waste their ability entirely  when they could be rendering artillery archers useless mid battle    orcs can t even waaaagh   ikit claw uses his doomrocket in interesting ways   many faction abilities used haphazardly or just in silly way  too many to list         skill their leaders like imbeciles  i know it d be a lot to go through at this point  probably      lords lls to do  but you need to have a template for how ai skill their lords  maybe attach it to campaign difficulty     ai won t red line their infantry  meaning legendary bonuses are overshadowed by turn       i know not every faction needs to do this  but most do  reducing legendary bonuses in game    but then not making them smarter to buffing their melee  means ai melee lines are actually weaker than player melee lines now consistently  and by a good amount    often picks ridiculous things like recruitment cost as a legendary ai   results in lords that are super weak  even if they can out level you a bit early game         not really their lack of game mechanics  but just something the ai does that makes the game super easy  they suicide their leveled lords constantly and end up only having level   lord spam by mid game  lords are powerful  and level   lords are a completely wash  the ai needs some way to either bring out higher level lords baseline later in the game  or they need immortality earlier         ai refuses to actually take cities like a normal human being     they will sack a city repeatedly    they will watch a city from a distance while raiding   they will raze cities they were perfectly capable of taking    they will siege a city that had no ability to put up a real fight against them   they will take      turns to take a few cities at the edge of your borders  when they could have just barreled in and trashed your side    they will take forever to expand  because they re spending so much time doing nothing    i understand this is likely done so players don t get bricked campaigns so easily  but on higher difficulties  maybe just add legendary  at this point   the ai should actually punish and obliterate you for leaving a flank open         i can t tell if this is my feeling or how it actually works  but it feels like legendary isn t getting bonuses to the newer resources  the ai is obviously less capable than the player and needs help here  they get things like bonus scrap from total warhammer    but things past the middle of tw  they don t seem to do well  ikit doesn t seem to get rat marines  i haven t seen the jade dragon be strong either despite being an s  faction  something just feels off here         vampire counts ai feels like it was neutered pretty hard by ca awhile ago  and while they are still an insanely strong campaign faction  it definitely feels legendary vampires are being reigned in     with all the bonuses legendary gives  we should see    stacks of higher tier vampire units prancing across the landmasses  but instead we mostly see low tier crap stacks  and not even that many of them  while   vlad can do okay  it s not even close to where his strength should be  he s only about as powerful as a player played vc  definitely not a full powered legendary difficulty  with the above difficulties expanding  he can slowly eat empire but never becomes a game ending threat  legendary difficulty is supposed to be insanely difficult  if people can t handle     cities vlad at turn    then they should go to a lower difficulty  i know this is a bit preachy     with empire getting giga buffed  i think letting the vc off the reigns and letting them actually just use their legendary bonuses to amass tons of grave guard monsters  if empire wins the duel they will have tons of higher tier stacks than vc can make    i suspect a problem might be the ai straight up doesn t realize where they can go to raise dead   which even the player has a difficulty at knowing  since it s still a broken ui     i also suspect ca just limits what the vc are allowed to do to limit player annoyance  again though  and i know this sounds preachy  people should play on an easier difficulty if they can t handle giga vcs         i m not sure the warriors of chaos are functioning properly for an ai at all  i m not really sure what to say here  woc is a top tier faction with tons of potential  yet played by the ai they don t seem to do much at all  i don t think they use the    attack for marauders  or get many stacks at all  i m not sure they re even upgrading their units properly         cathay is a mess  legendary cathay should have like    armies of high powered jade warriors by turn     and yet in game we re looking at maybe   good stacks  and some peasants  i have no idea what the ai is possibly doing wrong here   just about the only ai that seems to be properly playing on the campaign is greenskins  unfortunately  since they don t scale well as a faction  it s pretty easy to outscale them as basically anyone and gun down their armies    i have to format this without a   after the numbers  which looks really bad  but if i add the   it formats it super bad on reddit

tww players have some justified complaints   the ai is a coward that runs away leading to a series of unfulfilling and most commonly autoresolved minor settlement battles and sieges  no fun battles with our awesome fantasy armies  just boring autoresolves and mediocre siege battles against underwhelming garrisons  then it attacks with an army that s taking attrition  contrary to what some may say this is not  smart  on behalf of the ai  and no one ever even makes the argument that this is fun  because it s not   another complaint  which goes hand in hand with the first one  is that there are too many sieges and not enough field battles   a third complaint is the pacing of the campaign  the beginning is where the challenge  and fun  is  some people quit as early as turn      i have already won   they say  and they re right  too  this is a common complaint in strategy games  at some point the player has  won   no other power in the game poses a threat anymore  this is inevitable  but it doesn t have to happen so soon   these three problems      ai running     siege battles too common and no field battles     bad campaign pacing   won and boring after turn     all have the same root cause in my estimation  that being how sieges work in wh   and i don t just mean the battles themselves  i m also talking about the campaign mechanics surrounding them and their general place in the gameplay loop      why is the ai running  because it is outmatched and needs time to prepare the necessary forces to counter the player     because of    the ai is running  what is the players next move  take the ais settlements  duh  result  siege after siege after siege  ad infinitum     player easily expands cause the ai doesn t offer meaningful resistance  player becomes much too powerful much too quickly  boring  next campaign   as you can see this is all related  and what is the root cause   instant siege attacks   hear me out on this ok   why can t the ai gather it s forces to offer meaningful resistance to the player  because if the ai takes   turns to recruit  gather its troops the player will likely take as many settlements as the amount of turns it takes multiplied by the amount of armies the player is attacking with   even with economy and recruitment capacity cheats this is not a winning strategy for the ai   but it doesn t have to be this way   in reality actual siege battles are rare  siege attacks are costly in money and men  and the less you prepare  siege engines  scouting attacks etc   the worse you will suffer if you attack   but what does the defender even hope to accomplish  just try to inconvenience the enemy  no  they are waiting  but for what  reinforcements   and what will that lead to  an open field battle   ok so in reality the besieging army is far more likely to get the hell out of there if their commander thinks they are about to be attacked while they are besieging a castle city because it puts them at a disadvantage   you get where i m going with this  yeah  the people that are attacked have time to gather troops  sufficient troops to oppose their enemy in the open field   there is a game that does this  age of wonders    it takes time to prepare for a siege assaults in that game  sometimes   or more turns depending on what fortifications the city has and what besieging equipment magic  abilities you have access to   and let me tell you  this has led to some of the most fun open field battles  i have ever had in a strategy game   age of wonders also has field and siege battles as separate types   yes  you read that right  not siege battles  open field battles   why  because the ai has the time to gather its troops  and boy does it ever  in aow  you have stacks of   units    such stacks can fight on each side in any one battle  i have had the ai throw     stacks  in successive battles  at my besieging troops before   we could have something like that in this game  but not if we insist on being able to attack any walled city on turn   because our lord is a siege attacker or we have artillery etc   i told you there would be downsides   but it would solve  or rather mitigate  those three problems      the ai only runs to gather up it s troops and engage you in massive field battles     sieges will be rarer  you will have more massive field battles     player expansion will be slowed considerably  it will take longer to reach the  no one can beat me anyways  stage of a campaign   but it comes at the cost of a slower campaign  many players would probably hate that  people only have so much time to spend playing videogames   and just removing the siege attacker trait wouldn t be sufficient  not even close  it may seem like a small change but there are many downstream effects  so that takes massive amounts of dev time and money  probably necessitating a dlc to pay for it   now going into detail on all the other things i would do to spice up sieges would make this post even longer  and most of them would just be copied and adapted from aow  which does sieges really well imo  others would be taken from eltharion s vortex campaign     tl dr  a root cause of the big complaints in the title is our ability to instantly attack in sieges  both history and age of wonders   can give hints on how to make sieges and everything surrounding them better  but it will have the downsides of a slowed campaign and being a lot of work for the devs  and they would need to make money of off such changes   as with most things in life it s a trade off     what do you think   am i a combination of your favorite video game maker  whom i have supplanted in your opinion as the new     and the smartest historian and strategist because of this analysis   or am i an idiot whose ideas would ruin the game you love and who shouldn t even be allowed on the internet   ;escape_tarkow;1.0
