as noted from the description  i ve been at this for about a month now and i ve learned so much  i m very thankful for this community and a few others i follow because there s been some great insights noted here  and i m extremely appreciative      subs    k views  and    videos down   now a little background    i know the above stats are probably a bit above average  i am a software engineer by a background and i kind of grew up on youtube  so i knew a bit about algorithms ahead of time as well as some basic principles like seo  but beyond that  i was starting from scratch  my niche is mystery paranormal unexplained  it turned out to be harder than i expected but i m having so much fun with it  and that s what matters   here is my advice  humbly given  to all those who are starting out       you can t get depressed when your videos don t perform well  about        of what you will produce is likely going to only provide you with minimal traction  especially in the beginning  that s okay  and in fact even well experienced youtubers most of the time are lucky if they get a handful of viral videos  meshed with ones that have fairly minimal traction  very normal  you need a thick skin if you are going to stick in this game  do not get discouraged  just keep swimmin   you really could just be one video away from another viral one   you will never know if you give up though      quality really is more important than quantity but    quality is specific to your niche  which is something i think a lot of people don t fully understand  for example  in my niche  the use of arrows and red circles help draw the user s attention to your thumbnail  you don t have to use them all the time if the image naturally stands out  but if it s an image that has more opaque colors or is a bit hazy  i would definitely give it a try  and very well may extend to other niches as well  for some niches  it s big lettering on the thumbnail so people can read what to expect  also  try to make both the title and the thumbnail have something that stands out so that they work together  for example if your title says top three most mysterious places on earth   you don t need the thumbnail to say the same thing  you want to make it something that looks mysterious and eerie that s related to this topic  that way you now have captured both pieces of real estate      study  study  study  make a list of your competition  which means you need to find between   to    channels that you want to mimic as far as the details of how their channel operates  that includes things like how frequently they post  the general topics they post about  the format of their titles  the format of their thumbnails  etc  this will be a huge  if not the most important thing  that is going to help you take off  do not guess and do not reinvent the wheel  if you want to be successful at this  you need to mimic what s already working       audience engagement is a big part of how the algorithm works  in other words  youtube is generally looking for videos where people are still tuning in and not swiping away after about    to    seconds or more    that s because that s when ad revenue can really kick in  if you are not keeping or retaining around    to     of your audience past the    second mark on shorts  and at least   minutes of total watch time on your long form videos  you need to really refine how you go about doing this  remember at the end of the day  youtube is a content engagement channel  they get money by people staying engaged with what they are watching  that is their bread and butter  the longer someone watches  the more ads they can run  and thus the bigger cut of cash they get  and the bigger cut they can pass on to you   now that is not to suggest that every video you do that gets up to those marks will go viral  but this was a huge help in helping me refine what i crank out    also keep in mind that your long form videos really should be the entree of your channel  shorts really just pull people in to your channel as advertisement  but aren t the money grabber  nor are they what s going to usually drive the watch hours up as fast  though there are exceptions  you can be successful at either side of the house  you need both to balance  but the point is do not ignore long form content or this is going to likely take a lot longer  the big watch hours and cash come from longer form content  because that s where they get more ads in well viewers are watching      do not overpost or under post  yes you want to consistently churn out content  but you don t need to be insane about it  i am finding the sweet spot is between once a day and   to   times a week  any more than that  and i was finding that    to     of what i was making was not getting picked up by the algorithm  i think that s because they want consistent posts so they know when to drive traffic to it  this helps the algorithm trust your channel more in general comment it also allows your audience to become more akin to how frequently to expect you to post      the average youtube channel has to make around approximately     videos to hit the      subscriber mark on average  let that be your general guide as far as what you can expect  again  i think you are better off trying to focus on the quality of each of these then trying to post     and most of them fail to really do much traction       as much as it pains me to say it  list format  videos and things that are around grandiose titles really are the most successful these days  no one wants to watch a channel where we found the second best anything  that s why titles that have the top three this  the most extreme that  the craziest this    are getting the most traction from the algorithm  because that s what people are watching  if you are just starting out  i definitely recommend trying this format out  you re likely to get the most success with it       i did a lot of studying of matt par and jenny hoyos  i ve watched a few others as well but generally speaking  they definitely taught me a lot and have helped me so much  i recommend looking them up  and especially matt because he has short videos about virtually any niche you could think of that is profitable  you should aim to have at least   hours a week dedicated to research and learning from other creators  as my general advice  you will be amazed at what you find and it can only help you       going live can help you drive up your public watch hours faster     but not always  in addition  one issue i found with going live is that the rest of my videos plummeted while the live feed was on  i end up doing less hours than if i just had people focus on the long form content videos that i had already made  that s not to say that it will be like that for everyone  i m just saying that you definitely want to give it a try but pay attention to the results  i still plan to do it here and there  but it s not going to be the bread and butter of how i get to the      hour watch mark        you need to learn to get good at the tools you are using to make your videos and do not be afraid to experiment around with new ones  my first month  i probably invested around      in various tool sets for how i make my videos  but now and month two  i ve whittled that back to less than half of that    here are my recommendations for tools if you are looking for faceless  in order of how much i like them so far  please note that i am not in any way endorsed by or paid to promote any of these tools    vidiq and tubebuddy   both of these tools give you great insights on titles  descriptions  seo  meta tags  and a wealth of other information on both your channel and competitors channels  i recommend experimenting with both of them  and then decide which is going to work best for you  so far i have found that vidiq is by far and away the better tool  with the exception of search engine testing on certain titles in an ad hoc fashion and uploading thumbnails to shorts   pretty much everything else  vidiq wins  but without at least one of these  i have no idea how people manage  and that s the honest truth  their license is also start pretty cheap     hitpaw   download videos from other places  splice them together  add audio and text overlay any way you want  extremely easy to use  especially the downloadable application  and cheap    only about    bucks for a lifetime license  no ongoing subscription  i recommend this as a tool to help you put different videos together easily  it s definitely cut down on a lot of the editing time once we re up in the ai tools  important     hitpaw has a lot of tools  this one happens to be good  but not all of their tools are as good  again  don t be afraid to experiment for what works best for you   pictory ai   good for videos under    minutes  quick and easy to use  the bad side though is that the online version is lacking in a lot of basics and that can be frustrating  example   controlling the zoom in and out on images  adding arrows to images is a heck of a lot harder than it should be  etc    invideo ai   even more simple to use than pictory  you communicate what you want it to do via commanding the ai to do it for you  however this can be problematic  and it can jack your stuff up in such a way that it s hard to go back to even one iteration  i only use this for videos that are shorts based now for this very reason  there s no drag and drop functionality for the different scenes  the way that it sets the zoom in and zoom out all is also problematic  etc   openai images   excellent for creating custom thumbnails that are ai based and realistic looking  also fairly cheap to use  license is only around six bucks a month  you get a heck of a lot of credits as well  the downside though is that you have to get good with telling it how to render things or else it can be way off based on the description you provided  you can use the enhance input tool  but even that does its best guess  i m learning and getting better at it as i go along  but this goes back to the original point about spending time learning the toolset you have  that can be frustrating at times  but it s your best bet for how to make something that s high quality for your audience    chat gpt   i use the upgraded license so that i m getting the best generation out of it  this has been a godsend as it relates to creating scripts  however  the most important thing i found    you still need to go back and do some editing on these scripts  you can t just phone it in  because i m finding that the algorithm is starting to figure out when these are ai created  the more you can make this your own tone or your own unique spin  the better off you will be    others   i m experimenting with other tools  namely getting into those where you can drag an image and it can create a video for you based on that image  i don t have any specifics just yet because i literally just started a couple days ago  but this is the next step and trying to get the quality up on my videos       i have one video that went viral that did about   k view so far in the past two weeks  i ve learned a lot from that as far as what works  here s the biggest tips on what to do specifically for any given video     the hpc method is key    that stands for hook  plot build up  and call to action  in other words  the first    to    seconds of your video needs to draw the audience in and give them a good hook  that means something that s going to make them more curious and keep them interested  the second part of your video is going to build momentum based on the topic you ve already discussed in the intro hook  but you don t want to give the viewer everything at once    you want to walk them through what you are doing  how you did it  etc  and then there should be a grand finale at the end  after that  there should be a call to action of some type  like  subscribe  comment  set notifications  hit us up on patreon  or whatever   this is really the best way to sum up what works best for the algorithm in very general terms   you also want to keep this fairly simple  people get lost when things get too wordy or too complicated  also keep in mind that viewers attention spans are increasingly short  the more simple you can make it and the more interesting it is  the better off you are going to be  if you are just starting out  as noted above  check out what other channels are doing and mimic that    one of the best ways to get ideas is to search on youtube  and then order by view count and only look at things posted within the last week  if the keyword or topic you are searching for isn t getting videos that are banking at least    k views within a week  you certainly can t expect yours to go past that instantly  in addition  if you aren t seeing views in the past week that are at around that amount  you may want to adjust your keywords because if that is a trend  your niche may just be too small and you will have a hard time taking off just because of that    at the end of the day    youtube makes money off of what the viewers want to see  not what you want to generate  read that over and over again  you need to cater to what people want to watch  as a result  looking at what is currently trending and popular and what other people in your niche are doing that is trending and popular is going to be the most surefire way to ensure that yours eventually takes off  if you try to reinvent the wheel  this is going to be a huge struggle        experiment experiment experiment    and don t be afraid to fail  as they say an engineering  nobody learns much when things go right  we learn from when things fail  because then we learn what we could fix and do better  don t be afraid to experiment within your niche as far as subtopics  time of day  the different styles of your videos  and the different tools you use  however you want to do this carefully and only be messing with one thing at a time  for example  if you happen to get a video that goes viral  you want to study everything you can about that  in my particular case  the format was simple  there were only five or six total scenes  i actually made the script myself  and it built intrigue  i m using that as a way to move forward the rest of my content  i haven t been as successful with it yet but i m going to keep grinding and just pay attention to the trends        the analytics dashboard is also going to be key to your success  you need to get in the weeds  and especially look at the impressions rate and impressions click through  a lot of times people think that the algorithm is simply ignoring them  but if you look at the number of impressions after a week or two  generally speaking  you will see how many times it s been shown either in the browse features or on shorts feeds or other places  versus how much people are actually engaging with that content  that is going to be key to helping you figure out what your audience is really paying attention to  then all you have to do is study those videos and try to repeat the same or similar formats with slightly different topics        finally    this is going to be a labor of love  if you are not interested in the topic you are doing  this is highly likely to not succeed because you do need to sink a lot of time into this  but this also should be some fun  i feel like it s kind of like playing the lottery    and the odds go up the more you study  but i also really enjoyed this niche and i knew it was something that i could just have fun doing  if what you are doing isn t that  find something that is  i already know what my next niche is going to be after i get over the     k sub mark on this channel  and i m very excited about it  you really need to have fun while you do this or you are not going to likely be able to get through the grind of     plus videos       youtube is definitely a marathon  not a sprint  you need to play the long game about this  don t get so anxious about testing new things that you crank out       videos in one day  because it s noted above         of them probably aren t going to do much  that s ok  take your time  learn  and keep studying  stick to a set schedule and then let it go  you may want to consider uninstalling the youtube studio app from your phone because it definitely can get addictive as far as trying to watch the traffic coming and going  just go ahead and post it    and then walk away until at least a few hours or even a day or so later  you need to take breaks and relax  as that s usually when you are going to get the best ideas   i hope you guys find this helpful  i really appreciate this group as noted above  i ll keep people posted on what happens after the next month and how far i get  cheers and good luck everybody  it s a long grind but we can do this    ;image_video;0.0559134026520038
