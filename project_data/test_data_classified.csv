1ea0pbz;about  year ago  started  business in  very niche area doing some really interesting stuff with ai it took me about months to get it to  point where it was ready to go live which we did back in january since then we ve grown from nothing to having several thousand customers now and generating nearly  month in subscription revenue we re growing month over month all of our customers are consumers but we re starting to get phone calls from businesses which we re not super well equipped to handle but could if we made it  priority we spend almost no money on marketing the product sells itself as soon as someone sees it we offer  free hour trial of people who try it subscribe immediately we have no real competitors our tech is very unique and  suspect many have tried to duplicate it and failed  expect our growth to continue at the current pace for at least another year and then  think it will slowly taper back to maybe month over month assuming we opt not to enter any new markets there is enormous opportunity to use this same tech in adjacent industries but it would require  lot of sales marketing work to break into those markets this business was showing so much promise that back in march  left my job where  was making  year as  tech executive so that  could focus on this full time  ve now got  solid roadmap  wonderful and loyal customer base and an incredible growth trajectory but   tired and burned out and   love either sell the whole company or sell  chunk of it to an investor that would bring in enough capital to let us hire  few more people except  haven  got  clue how to even begin to find someone who might be interested in this   love any advice should  be looking for  vc angels how do  even start the search does the normal valuation rule apply here of maybe  revenue for the ebidta numbers   showing or does my month over month growth give me  boost;1;3;positive;positive;positive;positive;positive

190f9mm;as  background  did this exercise for computer vision  few years ago when the dgx was new at that point the data load characteristics were an initial brief minute iirc spike in data reads of around gib sec followed by  long fairly sustained load of about mib at the time most data storage vendors used marketing rhetoric that ai needed the fastest possible storage systems measured in per node performance over gib sec but my calculations showed that much much less expensive systems with much more attractive price performance characteristics with  peak throughput of around gib sec would increase training time for those computer vision models by about minutes over  hour training run its been  while so those figures might be out but they re still indicative my thesis at the time was that the money saved on more modest data storage and networking could be better allocated towards more gpu and memory having said that this was three years ago and llm  are not computer vision so  thought   look to see if hpc style   architectures are really justified for llm training in the same way they are for things like weather modelling or if the must have the fastest storage because faster goodest is just  hangover of hpc style thinking combined with hardware vendor incentives to sell the most expensive option in the interests of full disclosure  work for  storage vendor and my findings at the time were somewhat inconvenient  am now in  better position to promote  more balanced narrative hence my revisiting of this old research;0;5;positive;neutral;negative;neutral;neutral

191que7;to begin with  understand that the term ai is overused and overly broad and that most things dubbed ai are in reality machine learning algorithms ie fancy statistics  studied machine learning in undergrad specializing in natural language processing but  also took  class on other forms of ai  don  remember most of it but am vaguely familiar with the subject however  don  know anything about game development though  know that game ai is  distinct thing from the kinds of ml algorithms   more familiar with  know that you can  just jury rig chatgpt to play strategy games but  am wondering why the innovations we have seen in the last decade in nlp image generation and things like uber pricing haven  really translated to comparable advancements in video game ai   guessing that the usual algorithms games are built on are distinct enough from these other things that there isn  any applicability to each other in my ai class we learned about minimax and had to write  program to win mancala which is fairly trivial but  assume the principle is the same as more advanced games something like that requires solving every possible end state which  understand isn  feasible for most games  also understand that  unique challenge is making game ai good but not too good because otherwise it would be impossible to beat however  still don  fully understand why there hasn  been more success developing game ai that is challenging while still fun to play against to me both of these point to the benefits of more probabilistic based models maybe this is  stupid question but why isn  it possible to use human player activity to train  game model in  similar way that large language models are trained on  corpus of written text you don  need to create game rules for every possible permutation of decisions but can instead learn to approximate the general patterns that  successful player would make in  given situation  understand that this would be insanely complicated especially for certain types of game but is it just  matter of complexity or cost or is there  more technical reason why it  not possible  do know that there has been some research done on this with starcraft but these have been academic models used to solve the game rather than something companies use for their base product if it   matter of ai  developed like this being so good that they re not fun to play against why isn  it possible to model behavior on more mediocre players to introduce unoptimal play that  more organic and immersive than the ai just doing something obvious stupid;2;4;positive;neutral;negative;neutral;negative

1b1s4nl; don  think pure text video will be the workhorse of the film industry in times to come it seems to me that video video is going to be the actual tool of the trade at least until the ai models can eat entire books and spit  complete movie in  single shot video to video will likely either solve or substantially diminish the problems of wrong physics and extra limbs it will also give great creative control and flexibility however keeping objects consistent beyond seconds will likely require additional ai sub models for each object similar to lora or dreambooth for stable diffusion which is labor and resource intensive ultimately if video generators develop to solve object consistency over hour long time spans they will likely result on the cgi side on  more realistic render engine that converts rough video to finished video and on the vfx side on less overall video editing work crucially it already has proven the capability of keep frame to frame and object consistency at least up to seconds interpolation between two videos extrapolation backwards and forwards of  video the catch is that unless the model can be fed book length prompts and output movie length videos in one go both cgi and vfx video video pipelines will come at the expense of creating ai sub models for each object that needs to remain consistent across several minutes maybe what will happen over time is that people will start creating libraries of video ai sub models and selling those individual objects much like  artists sell models today or how videographers sell stock footage there will be  wolf model  th century firearm model  keyboard model and so on the workflow would be to assign these descriptors to rough  shapes or physical props in the set and then tie it all together with global text prompts and feed it along the original rough video so that the ai spits out versions of the final thing to be chosen and comped instead of  models and  rigs we could start seeing the development of specialized ai primitives inside of   environment something like sd  controlnet with open pose but in  and animated across time an animation ai will move the rig  model ai will instruct the appearance of the object and  general video video ai will produce the final product as to what is going to happen to the job market  believe that unlike what happened in the  art realm we will have the creation of as many jobs as those that are lost this seems like  crazy uninformed and high on copium take but hear me out at the same time that producing  movie becomes cheaper and big studios start scaling down and;0;5;positive;neutral;negative;neutral;neutral

1ctio4b;hi as the title says   thinking on the idea of having  device or app that allows dictating or even record  discussion transform into text push text to ollama local ai platform of your choice allowing to then take advantage of note taking minutes building etc  know there are devices plaud note comes to mind but  don  particularly enjoy the fact that it doesn  give any freedom on the ai platform being used behind the scenes and that may implicate that the device may become obsolete with time also privacy anyone came across any project to build  recording device with whisper or another type of software and hardware like  pico zero  and  respeaker pi device thanks in advance for the participation and brainstorm that  hope this post generates;0;5;positive;neutral;negative;neutral;neutral
