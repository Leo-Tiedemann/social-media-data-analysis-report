 first of all  i m doing this somewhat begrudgingly  because i don t want ppl to  play    pay for pve  it s not that i don t want you to enjoy the game  quite the opposite  i just don t think bsg deserves a single penny for they lazy and incompetent implementation of pve  if you got access thru eod   unheard already  by all means  go have fun  but please don t buy it separately  they did not do a good job with it  tarkov is a great game in general  so of course it can still be fun considering the basic framework is fine  but specifically as a dedicated pve experience  it sucks  ai is    dynamic  repetitive and poses no real cheese free challenge once you understand how they work  they are either braindead or frustrating  with hardly anything in between    long loading times  shortened raid times  no offline play and no mod support     way to go bsg  way to go     now  rant over  to the actual content   you really have to learn about the specific ways tarkov bots work  they aren t very hard once you understand them  but i know they can feel crazy tough   daunting when you re new to it all     so here s a few tips to hopefully make it easier to deal with the ai       the ai usually knows when you scope in on them  so better be prepared   they usually aim for limbs  so always bring cms   surv kits   they can sometimes track you through but bushes   cover  make sure you have good cover before you engage or make sure you can quickly get to solid cover once they are aggo ed   they can see you from very far away  especially raiders and pmcs   they re practically blind at night after around   m  if you have nvgs  maps like lighthouse become a cakewalk   pmcs   raiders have aimlock   laser aim  you can t out aim them  it s kill first or be killed        never never never re peak the same angle in the first       seconds  they will just kill you  i m serious  if you must  wait       seconds  they will have disengaged their aimbot after some time  this takes some discipline and getting used to  but don t think you can just quickly get rid of them from the same corner  wait or reposition        they don t really have flinch or get aim punched  they ll just keep blasting you  so you either have to kill them immediately or switch angles   positions  don t keep firing  especially center mass with bad ammo and expect them to no return fire  they will and you regret it    if you want to know where they are exactly  use your voicelines  i feel like many ppl don t know that both scavs  less consistent  and raiders   ai pmcs will consistently answer to your voicelines  making it much easier to pinpoint their location    pmcs   raiders will often aggressively push you once you engage them  so consider your location well  if you re is a small room with just one door let s say  and you only have    round mags  and   ai charge at you  better make sure you have good ammo and good aim or it ll be back to main menu in no time  they can also bug and shoot through closed doors  so don t feel safe just because you closed the door    generally  bring some sort of magnification  more ammo  more meds  bigger mags are a life saver  don t use pump action shotguns  if sniping  bring a sidearm  learn about ammo and penetration  so you don t have to wonder why the scav wearing armor you just tried blasting center mass with shitty ammo suddenly blasts your head off     from comments   scavs often keeps spawning in seemingly endless waves in pve  at the very least you should be ready to fight a lot of them  especially if you want to take it slow   don t know how to quest super quickly   efficiently  bring as much ammo as you can   hope that helps  if you can think of anything else  post it in the comments  i ll add it to the list ;escape_tarkow;0.1287411853776743
i m going to give my tldr of the slapfights in the subreddit     nixos   url  is an open source os that many people volunteer their free time to build     anduril   url  makes autonomous ai drones to kill people using nixos  they have also hired multiple community members to do so   there s larger drama that spills outside of reddit on this but the tldr is anduril is sponsoring nixcon an in person convention about nixos  and people aren t too happy about it  a detailed explanation of the community drama can be found  here   url  if you care   this culminated in one of the community members and anduril employees receiving a temporary suspension to the project  the primary reason as i can surmise is because they were kind of a jerk about being against gender minority representation in leadership   drama thread    employee of anduril gets a temporary suspension from the nixos project  turns to the subreddit to say goodbye    url     goodbye  you have made yourself difficult to be missed      thanks derpface        no problem  your username remind me of someone who is directly complicit in creating tools used in a genocide  and who actively concern trolls about minorities  cannot think of his name for the life of me  though    link   url       after some digging  it appears that the root of this is that nix maintainers are limiting the involvement of people who work for defense companies  read  weapons manufacturers               why would that be reasonable  those people make weapons that keep you safe  you d be the first in the corner in a puddle of piss and years of you were invaded because your country didn t have proper  weapons  to protect you        those weapons killed my innocent family members    young girls who never hurt a fly in a war that probably happened before you knew how to type    link   url    hope you slip and fall into an unassuming volcano  or something equally awful   	thanks   link   url    you did your best to prevent any constructive discussions and successfully failed to show any growth or sympathy      errmmmm ackshyually you are the one stifling constructive discussion good sir  constructive discussion is when we never listen to minorities of any kind   link   url    to be fair you lost me when you called the need for minority representation  discrimination   again and again  like    times in the same thread  you failed to acknowledge the power dynamics at place  and how a  non political  stance just hurts us by default  and what s worse you just dismissed the need to hold a wider conversation on the basis of your own feelings about privilege and discrimination  while ignoring what people were telling you repeatedly  edit  see  that s why we just leave these spaces  fuck the alt right and everyone who classifies ethnic and sexual minorities as  political   you ruin good spaces with your toxic waste of ideologies     i m an anarchist libertarian  barefoot in the garden  ecology loving homestead veteran hippie  with a decent sized lgbtq  friend group since i live near seattle  they are good people if it weren t for the fact that most of them are lawyers    link   url   drama thread    clarification on why guy from thread   was suspended   url    disgusting  labeling a man based on an idea that would ve been logical pre       so much hearsay and putting words into his mouth  dei needs to go away  as it is a plague of exclusion and oppression olympics  it has no place in a free society  it has no place in open source  it s cultural shift with good intentions but naviagted terribly  nix  this is just wrong and your hearing the man but not listening    link   url     is this about the project excluding defense companies  if so that doesn t make sense to me  open source should just be tools and allow anyone to contribute      it s about control over nix  and the defense sponsor was just the issue being seized upon           link   url     if you label me as a  racist fascist bigot   then anything i say is malicious      you ve been posting like this a lot over the last couple days  this attitude indicates to me that you are not actually planning on changing anything about your behavior  and you don t actually take any criticism levied against you seriously  you simply frame it as a ridiculous caricature that can be discarded and ignored  so the whole  i take full responsibility  thing rings fairly hollow        who the fuck cares  stop trying to wrangle out some kind of twisted confession  we have churches and preachers to do that  he s a volunteer    he doesn t owe you anything when are you going to stop being obnoxious    link   url   drama thread    multiple community members quit the project  some because of the ai drone strike thing  some because guy from thread   got banned    url    i for one support lgbtq inclusion in autonomous murder drone manufacturing  it ll fix both issues    link   url    that s great  i don t disagree in principle  but what are we going to do about all the people leaving over this  though  a significant maintainer just left over the anduril sponsorship fiasco  and over a dozen others have followed him  i think this deserves some airtime and discussion      thats great  but what are we going to do when the unchecked mod team banned everyone that contributes and doesnt share their opinion  they clearly shift the allowed debate in their favor  this allows them to shape this project after their own liking  this deserves some discussion  but the mod blatantly flag or ban every critic they see  there is no healthy or solution oriented debate to be had under those conditions    link   url      the thought of any of my work contributing to someone s death by drone makes me feel physically ill  this can be said about almost any open source contribution    in fact  it can be said if you pay taxes in almost any well developed nation  that uses drones to defend itself   a    k per year sponsorship is pocket change  but heck  you can even think that s    k they have less to spend on drone parts    link   url    why not try to be apolitical  for example here  used for horrific things   people have morals     horrific things  arent absolutist  you are saying horrific people with morals means  that their side side is the good one that isnt absolutist     if you take money from everyone  how not take it from one company could be political  or at least less than not take it     i would agree that isnt good argument  but not absolutist  you can still be against it  protest against  work against it etc  if he said for example  in fact  it can be said if you pay taxes in almost any well developed nation  that uses drones to defend itself   so why try   i would agree with you    link   url ;23_people_facebook_fake_post;0.12376800135312913
   the context      a user posts a screenshot of a tweet of an ai enhanced image of   url  ella purnell s backside to  r facepalm  the image in question is a promo image from the new fallout television series in which she stars  the implication of the tweet is that her ass is not big enough for the user s liking  oop calls this tweet  peak incel behavior    the sub quickly starts to question the definition of the word incel  if this is actually inappropriate  and if a redditor s girlfriend is imaginary        the drama        one user sees no problem      there is nothing wrong with liking bigger asses  there is  however  something wrong when you go around editing an image of an actress because  her flatness bothered you enough  not every depiction of women has to pander to the male gaze and be overtly sexual  if you don t see what s wrong with this person s behaviour  then i don t know what to tell you buddy    url      this is deplorable behavior  of course  but words have meaning  and so do superlatives  if that s the worst kind of incel for you  the worst kind of behavior you can imagine     well you must have a very peaceful life and that s cool for you  but you d have to discover the real world     the answer is  there is nothing inherently wrong with editing an image  in poor taste  maybe  but a pretty insignificant offense  it s not like the dude is campaigning to have her kicked off the show for having a flat ass       this smacks of hysterical reaching for the sake of being upset and just causes unnecessary noise       also it was probably a reference to the video game  in which the suit is similar to the one on the right  and also it winked to the fact that the game has as always a lot of  perfect  body        yeah  i just assumed it was something from the game  people just need to clutch their pearls about something         the hashtag state clearly they are putting the series and the game in comparison  also the body type  waist up  of the actress is slightly changed to better resemble the body type of the female playable character in the series     continued       they don t state that clearly  you are just apologist            maybe it was a joke  maybe you didn t get it or it was in poor taste  either way stop being a puritan  live and let live  what it looks like to me is a referential joke to how the bubble butt is one of the first mods made for bethesda games almost every time after a ui fix      or maybe you could take two seconds to check out their profile and see that their entire twitter account is committed to using ai to overly sexualise  woke  female character designs  this is a    year old man getting angry whenever a female character is not presented as a sex symbol and using ai to  fix  this  issue       i am not saying he is the next hitler for doing what he does  all i am saying is that this is peak incel behaviour       i never understand why people describe these people as angry    bro  they horny not angry  just wait until you find out about fan fiction    all those evil    year old incel women sexualising random characters from films  how dare they         people are sexual deviants  and whether it s through thinking  writing  pictures  cartoons  etc  people will sexualise anything       nah  i doubt you ve ever seen peak incel behavior  you find that in the army or playing a civil war sim  you find that when someone plays imperial guard in warhammer generalizations as a joke   those dudes really hate women and the way they view them is unhinged and downright scary  this is more likely someone trolling you  it s working      is a user s girlfriend fake      idk if it s incem behavior to like juicy booties  my girlfriend pays more attention to ass than i do    url      there can be female incels and they can find partners       the word incel and finding a partner seem to be in conflict with each other lol       eh it happens  you can have the mindset and not be single  there are such things as toxic relationships         or in my case my girlfriend works out so she pays more attention to woman s bodies and has goals she wants to reach and a juicy booty is one of them  people like booty     continued       is she canadian      if canadian is a code word for black then yes  if not then no       it s a code word for imaginary  sorry  i ll stop  just look up the exception that proves the rule       anatomy is discussed      to be fair most women have some ass  and would not be flat in a jumpsuit  so it s more unrealistic to make her flat  i don t know why people really care  it s just a mod  i don t see anything wrong with altering a character to fit your own sinceabilities  fan fiction and art does that all the time  and no one hates on that    url      this isn t a game  this is a real actor in a suit  they didn t  make her flat  that s her wearing clothing  tf are you talking about      altering a real human to fit your  sinceabilities   sensibilities  when it s just making her ass bigger and in skin tight bottoms of a jumpsuit that don t match the top is just incel behaviour       quiet  i clearly didn t know this was a person  why do they have person advertising fallout        then why did you feel so confident to say what you did         cause people complain all the time  about sexualizing female video games characters  i thought that s what this was  and they were making fun of a fan for drawing moding the vault dweller like this wasn t sure if it was a mod or art      continued        wasn t sure if it was a mod or art    again  why did you feel confident to say what you said if you couldn t take two seconds to look it up  it s a rhetorical question  i m not actually asking you  i m telling you it s better to just keep your mouth shut when you re not sure      cause i can t just google fallout fan art and expect to find this  there s tons of it and that s what i thought this was       but you can just  not comment  right  or can you literally not help yourself        why would not comment  i have no reason not to  i can t know i m wrong beforehand  also i originally seen this post in gamingcirclejerk  now i m really confused cause this has nothing to do with the game  so why is it there         so you physically can t help yourself from commenting  even when you have no idea what you re talking about  maybe that s why you have issues having normal conversations with people     continued       no  that not what i said i have no reason to stop myself  cause i thought i did know  it s not like i would think i have no idea on something and then comment on it  i thought it was about something i did know what i was talking about      but you didn t know  and you didn t know that you didn t know  and you likely don t know a lot of things  but for some reason you don t think to make sure you know what you re talking about when you talk  i m telling you  if you stfu a lot more your life will get better       yeah but i can t know i didn t  know  till i find out  i mean if i never made this comment i never would have known        sure you can  going forward just assume that you don t know anything because you obviously don t  or just keep complaining that you can t have a normal conversation because you rush in headfirst without knowing anything  keep arguing  it s totally getting you somewhere         well then i just wouldn t speak ever  that s worse for me  if i have to choose between it just being my problem  and making everyone else s problem too i would much rather do that  if it s everyone else s problem it s also their responsibility to fix it     continued       i m sure your life will work out just great with that mentality  good luck      insults are made      this is a real person who s photo has been edited you absolute chud   url      hey fuckface  why do you assume everyone would know this  only fallout material i ve ever heard of is the games       i don t see why that s relevant  given the context of your comment         porn brain damage is real        it clearly does  cause if a fan is making content for a game they like  they tend to make what they like           literally brain damaged individual        that s also not relevant because my point was about your original comment  considering balloon butt more realistic than the actual picture of a real person  but yea thanks for proving my point cumbrain     continued       but you said in the context of my comment not mine and your comment  if we are just talking about the context of my comment i didn t know that was a person  words mean things when you put them in a certain order  honey  i know that s hard for you       words mean things when you put them in a certain order       when i do yeah  but apparently not for you jesus      jokes are made      nah just peak male ingenuity edit  it s a joke  if you downvote karma s gonna get you   url      that is an low bar  like if the best you can imagine achieveing with your life is a photoshopped butt you may as well just wander into traffic  ctrl c ctrl v is not that difficult       hell this is an ai prompt so its not even that much work  its  comptar maek butt  and some script sighs and gives the monkey a pixel       yeah  i m sorry you thought i was serious  i was exaggerating         so much for humor        everyone has their own talents  im sure youre good at like  eating muffins or something  dont sweat it ill be funny for you       the real low bar is expecting that it s socially acceptable to suggest suicide       wait how many times are you gonna respond to one post here chief  admission limit    pick a lane      is any of this real      you know it s all virtual  right  edit for example  negative comments about paparazzi pictures of scarlet johansson were wild  there s nothing wrong with the way she looks  however  costume designers will make artistic decisions about a character s clothes  it might be polarising  but in the end  it s all virtual  people will always have something to complain about    url      uh no  that actress is a real person       because actors just get out of the shower and put on their everyday clothes to go on set        i really don t see your argument  just because she s currently doing her job means she can t possibly be depicted the way a normal human would look         the whole argument seems like a storm in a teacup     continued       i couldn t give less of a damn about whether or not it s important  i just want to know what you re arguing      check my edit  either way the costume designer goes  there will always be someone who complains       colour me surprised       so your argument is that because someone would always complain  the guy in the post is perfectly justified in playing with this woman s image like a doll  am i getting this right        no  but there s no use in getting nickers in a twist over guys like this         then what  is  your argument  clearly i m confused             you know that s a real photo of a real human actress on the left  right       on a film set        incel behavior exhibit a        because having an anime avatar is so grown up             because you didn t jump to personal insults     incel behavior exhibit a     not an insult when it s true       so tell me about your childhood  is rejection something that you are afraid of        lol case in point  you be good now         you keep mentioning things that you describe as being embarrassing  is there something we should know

how will the rise of ai generated content impact creative industries   the rise of ai generated content is poised to significantly transform creative industries  presenting both opportunities and challenges  this transformation is characterized by the integration of ai technologies into various fields such as art  music  literature  and design  fundamentally altering how creative work is conceived  produced  and experienced    impact on creative processes  augmentation of human creativity  ai tools are increasingly being used to augment human creativity rather than replace it  for instance  generative ai applications can assist artists and writers by providing inspiration  automating repetitive tasks  and enhancing productivity  this symbiotic relationship can lead to innovative outcomes  allowing creatives to push the boundaries of their work     art and design  ai can generate original artworks by learning from vast datasets of existing art  allowing for the creation of pieces that blend various styles and techniques  tools like dall e and midjourney exemplify this capability  enabling artists to explore new visual concepts     writing and content creation  natural language generation  nlg  technologies  such as gpt   can produce text that mimics human writing  making it useful for generating articles  marketing copy  and even literature  this efficiency can free writers to focus on higher level creative tasks     music production  ai is also making strides in music  where it can compose tracks  suggest arrangements  and even perform  this not only enhances the creative process but also democratizes music production  allowing more individuals to participate in music creation    economic considerations  job creation and displacement  while there are concerns about ai displacing human jobs  particularly in content creation  the reality may be more nuanced  ai is expected to create new roles in fields that require human oversight  creativity  and emotional intelligence  for example  there will be a growing need for professionals who can manage ai tools  curate ai generated content  and ensure quality control      emerging roles  new job categories may emerge  such as ai content curators or ai ethics consultants  as industries adapt to the integration of ai technologies     creator economy  the creator economy  valued at around   billion  may see shifts in how independent creators monetize their work  ai can lower barriers to entry  allowing more individuals to create and share content  but it may also lead to a saturation of low quality content that diminishes the value of human made work     challenges and ethical considerations  as ai generated content becomes more prevalent  several challenges arise     quality and authenticity  there is a risk that the proliferation of ai generated content could lead to a decline in quality  as the nuances of human emotion and context may be lost  maintaining the integrity of creative work will be essential     copyright and ownership  the legal implications of ai generated content are still being debated  questions regarding authorship  copyright  and intellectual property rights will need to be addressed as ai tools become more integrated into creative processes      cultural impact  the emotional depth and cultural significance of human creativity cannot be replicated by ai  this raises philosophical questions about the nature of art and creativity  challenging traditional notions of originality and expression    conclusion  the rise of ai generated content is reshaping the landscape of creative industries  presenting a complex interplay of enhancement and disruption  while ai offers powerful tools that can augment human creativity and increase productivity  it also brings forth significant challenges related to job displacement  quality  and ethical considerations  as the creative sector navigates this new terrain  the focus will likely shift towards collaboration between humans and ai  fostering a future rich with innovative possibilities and new forms of artistic expression ;ai_art;0.1398278079669245

when ai was first introduced  the internet was free to be scraped  even though scraping was a legal grey area  it was done in order to create the first successful ai chatbots  we memed about how the internet was being sold back to us at a subscription cost  it was a closed and proprietary system feeding off of public data      before ai  no one made a post realizing it would make its way into a training set  no one posted a video thinking it would be used to train sora  and when ai become successful  few questioned whether or not this was okay  thankfully  artists have been the first to see a danger in ai  and they pull back their best work  but is that the internet we want      with the advent of social media  we became privacy conscious  but social media became the spice of the internet  and we decided to overlook the fact that we did not have much control over our data  who cares if google can read all of our emails  who cares if facebook can read our dms  even when mark zuckerberg s controversial remark became public  we continued to give him our data   they trust me   dumb fucks       years later  public email protocols are still being used  and now facebook has turned meta  hoping to collect much metadata and grab you by the eyeballs  to paraphrase the joker   no one bats an eye       i remember in high school  when weed was illegal  i showed a picture of a bong i had just purchased to a friend through a facebook dm  and one day  the cops came to my door because my brother had gotten in trouble  seeing me  the cop said   i have a picture of you holding a bong   social services were called  and in my living room  the lady said   anything you post on the internet is there forever   my trust in facebook was destroyed  i could not believe that law enforcement somehow had access to my facebook dms  when facebook locked me out of my account asking for a photo of my government id to regain control  i deleted my account instead  hide yo kids  hide yo wife      we as westerners worry about social credit scores  but in reality  these systems are probably already being built secretly without the public being aware      i think we have fallen asleep to privacy discussions we used to have back in the early days of social media  now with the advent of ai  i feel that we need to have these discussions again      one day ai will be ubiquitous  it s too convenient not to be  we will all have access to jarvis  students will use it to accelerate their learning  businesses will use it to build and serve  people will use it for journaling  telling it all their personal information  and it will be therapeutic  pointing out connections you were unable to make  it will manage your busy life  reminding you of upcoming events and appointments  where is the irony here  is it that ai meant to give us freedom will control us  or is it that social media was meant to connect us  but we will all talk to ai instead      in the dark knight  when bruce wayne reveals the mass surveillance system to lucius fox  who is played by morgan freeman  known for being the voice of god  he remarks   this is wrong   bruce says it s necessary to catch the joker  reminding us of the argument that mass surveillance protects us  lucius replies   as long as this machine is at wayne enterprises  i won t be       having tried ai  and seeing it s potential for privacy abuse  i agree with lucius  sentiment  so i will be working toward creating privacy focused alternatives to proprietary ai chat systems  i hope you see the danger  too      he who controls the spice controls the universe       url ;23_people_facebook_fake_post;0.14445434094048812
i was in  rd race  australia  of first season with aston martin  bringing some strong high speed upgrades for my man alonso  thinking this would be the time to get this man a podium or even a win    first part of the race goes well  both alonso and stroll in  rd and  th  only  s behind verstappen and perez after    laps  the times start coming down and alonso actually gets in fights with the red bulls and overtakes them for p   stroll follows  both my cars were on aggressive mode with avoid kerbs and drive in clean air  as it was a strong combo for the tyre temperature and wear      the race continues and both cars are consistently as fast as red bull  battling them basically the entire time  ferrari was right behind  but wasn t able to get into any fights  mercedes was basically an entire pitstop distance behind before the pitstops started happening  we pit late  same time as the red bulls  thinking to go for a   stop instead of a   stop       and here s where shit gets weird  red bull  ferrari and mercedes all suddenly find     seconds each lap on both of my cars   to be fair  mercedes did start on mediums and went to soft  so they were going to be quicker   my times were were around the same as compared to the softs  while all other cars set some amazing times  i then alt f  d as we went from      podium chance to p  and p      did i fuck up the strategy or did the ai really just become op    also i m having my doubts on the aggressive mode  as it does like to overheat the engine ;race_game;0.3200257561109266
ok  this is not a question for udio  i m a music pro and i ve been through the terms of agreement and fully understand  according to them  ai generated work is original work and you  own the copyright  instantly as it s done  however  if there is future litigation to this claim  they are not held responsible for court fees  etc past       this is a regular and rather staunch tactic that a lot of media maker platforms use in their terms  it s understood    i don t need random regular people offering  common sense  advice  either  i mean    go for it  but just understand  that isn t the type of response that i m searching for  i m looking for music professionals and or legal   intellectual property   entertainment ones especially  i also understand that this is not actual legal advisement from here lol  for sure  just thinking about it and testing the waters    here is my argument which is  pro ai   in case you don t know   the us copyright office  and lawyers in general  are extremely clear that this tech is  not a human being   and so therefore not applicable for copyright registration  however  there is plenty of grey area    because   for one   dj s and electronic composers and producers have been doing  source content  work for decades  what that means is that gadgets  tech  software  and or samples or full plays of other source material  ie other people s songs  was a heavy part of the actual composition  the dj s   these days   regularly register after obtaining a license agreement and permissions to use the content in their composition  electronic producers regularly use arpeggiators  beat makers  randomized note generators  even melody and chord generators  they don t garner permissions or licenses of any kind and register for copyright protections at will as if the music had been naturally created  by a human being        the idea   with the  nd example  the electronic producer   is that the  human was running the thing  auditioning the parts and picking parts  etc   this is of course exactly what ai producers are doing  but  because of an ignorant  very surface understanding of the process  the lawyers in general   as well as the us copyright office   basically bans ai work within a copyright  because a human being didn t make it   even though a human started it with a vision  or some type of hackneyed ordering and organizing of key terms to get it going   including usually lyrics or at least part lyrics  and then  just like an electro producer would do with library cues they purchased  they audition each section until it matches according to their human taste  the human does this over and over   up to   or   times if they do it to the      cap  they even go back and  remix  certain sections at their human will   and udio  at least if you  publish  the work  gives themselves the right to allow anybody on their platform to remix your stuff as well  without your permission  not the point  but just making that clear for those that don t realize that could happen        now looking at  my case   i especially go on with udio  because i am not their main demographic  which is just regular people looking for entertainment  and the ability to create new playlists as background music for their personal activities  or possibly a birthday present or romantic one personally  or a fun joke to share around  as well  the main demo might use  free music  in the background of their website and social media  if they wish  that is the main focus and target of the udio platform  however  there are those of us who are truly in the game   the music industry  i am one of them  i ve done singles that were in billboard s top   and hot     i m even more regularly a music teacher  i have been with electronic music since literally the early   s  in other words  when ai spits out a section  i know what those parts are doing and i could replay them  while ai spits out numerous vocals from however many singers combined together to make a  new vocalist   i could re sing a lot of those parts  and i could use ai vocal tech for the others   driving my vocal notes past my natural range and giving me tones that are not present in my vocal  in other words  i could   as a lot of musicians on these threads suggest    use the ai work as a scratchpad and re do basically the same thing as a human and i m      clear to copyright it   i m coming from an actual music industry viewpoint  i don t want to re do the shit  the shit is practically perfectly mixed  i certainly would split it up and do a light new mix of it  and a slight  subtle mastering on it to make it even  wider  or something  but its essentially  there    ready to go   in   minutes flat    i have tried   things to  test the originality  of my new beats and music i came up with on here   or more aptly put  me and ai came up with them  with ai in the lead since it doesn t know how to follow and obey instructions accurately  a lot of the time  it s just too much of a creative genius   i have had to work with humans like this before lol   i have had shazam listen to identify  no dice   the beat does not exist until i made it with ai  then more stringently  i uploaded them onto youtube in private posts  we all know the youtube audio sniffers are extremely fast and will block your post nearly instantly if your music is owned by someone or something  no dice   the stuff posted just fine    and so  now that i  know  specifically that each of my new works is actually new work  according to sound scan    the only legal disposition which is in my way  potentially in the future if i release it with music videos and some type of marketing and it catches on  there have already been minor charters on billboard with ai generated music   is the idea that  humans didn t make it   but  as we in the trenches already know  ai itself will tell you in plain english that it is dumb as a rock until we start interacting with us  ai  itself  has nothing before we ply for its training with instructions  the  music industry s  fear is based that sometimes it might spit out too much of  one song in training  than it is supposed to via the algo    and so you end up with someone else s beat  from experience so far  i don t see that happening  although some might be sort of close  which is not at all unheard of in chart toppers and commercial music in general    udio s  viewpoint that they do protect themselves from in case that happens is that  if you put the exact chain of prompt terms  you will get the exact same beat as someone else  because the training isn t infinite   from my limited  but rather vast  usage of this interface  i would consider this to be   in a million chance    but i guess it   could   happen  however  even if that happens  and   creators end up starting the exact same seed and it comes out the exact same way  certainly the development of it would end up being vastly different  because   as a lot of regulars and starter music makers have found with this   consistency is a real issue  for me  actually in the music game for money  i am elated by this creativity  i think the  nd verse should sound similar  and  nd chorus should be the same as  st just  built up  more  normally   there are exceptions where its more of a break down   but everything after that is just fair game  and ripe content for themes the remix could apply    to focus everything i m discussing into a few takeaways  which i am inquiring and wondering about       ai is a tool  started and guided intricately by humans  if electro producers and creators use gadgets and software to assist and help them come up with beats and music and even melodies  and they easily garner copyright protections  than so should ai users  the copyright office does indicate that there is  grey area    meaning it depends essentially how much work you put in  that its a different case if you just spun a beat off of  light rock  not too heavy  guitars  male vocals  vs one where the prompt list is     times longer  uses musical terms beyond genre commands  uses literary and abstract concept words  etc  it s even more different if the prompt changes section by section  as is my case nearly all the time   and certainly its even more of a thing if all those lyrics are yours   in my case i would say     of them are  i couldn t help it  the ai feeds back and  replies  to my seed and my sections with intelligence   i m a producer  supportive by nature   let the entity get its voice in there too  that is not anything but a strength  and relevant much more than me making music  imo       copyright office and entertainment lawyers are naturally biased against this  the argument of gear and gadgets as far back as the late    s creating parts or even most of the music in cases is either unknown to them  or explained away  and ai somehow is different and does not fit this mold  ai is barred from copyright protections  although grey area and other statutes allow them to give a claimant at least partial ownership of it     that all said  i m looking forward to hearing what the folks here have to say    like i said  quick surface comments from regular people saying shade like  it s not real music  or tripe like this is welcomed  but clearly not what i m looking for  i m looking for people to reply to my actual viewpoints  including my argument that this is a tool and just  more of the same  as far as modern production stems from in our modern era and going way back into the catalogue with part mechanical   electronic production  i mean    that s why they call it electro  etc   i understand flying these takes and output into my daw system and rejiggering everything  re doing nearly everything is a workaround and i m down     but it bums me out  it would take dozens of hours if not more  i just did    songs and some of them are real good  are they  mine   they aren t udio s  unless it spits out literally singles that exist  which mine did not   it s not the music industry s either  so if i am  barred  from making royalties off of it  and it exists    who claims that writer s share    a lot of this salient legal ideas i ve been collecting for the last day has me tending to hybridize  and fly beats into my system and use them accordingly  just like i would from library cues i purchased and the like  that s cool  and of course  safer   especially if  i  sing and or people i ply or hire   but i don t want to  i started the project  i lead produced it  i was picky  i only created a sequence of events how i wanted  and it s my lyrics  i didn t move on with each segment until it was  my  melody and chords   the type of sound i was looking for  and i know what all those sounds  are  and stuff  technically   what melody notes  chords  bass parts and instrumental techniques  etc     thanks for reading this whole essay  you rock  i wish your ai music projects damn well and i suggest as a music person to really go for it   what comes out of the box is great  but so is everyone else s  what comes out once you twist it and turn it and really shake it and test it  challenge it  so much more on a higher level  which is where i believe ai  and you  want to be    ;ai_art;1.0
rant post  it s a long one  tldr  perfect ai is boring  old man wants to have fun holy shit that was cool moments   but seriously  can i get a fucking penalty or free kick please  they never  fucking  foul  and on the very  very rare time they do  it s a random leg breaker in midfield from behind for no reason  i am not joking or exaggerating when i say  in this games lifecycle so far  since day     day fucking     i ve never had a penalty  and i can count on one hand how many free kicks i ve had  why can their  ft    defenders with less than    agility turn on a dime when i m sprinting and try to cut inside with my speedy  tricky agile player  why can skill moves not just fucking work and not have the ai stand there and  perfectly  track you before putting in an inch perfect tackle  regardless of stats   why do they  always  need to cut out that little intricate pass i tried to split them open  even if they have terrible interceptions and or defensive awareness  why do they win  every  physical battle  regardless of stats  or on the odd occasion you do win it  it gets taken back for a foul somehow  how is it that my     rated defender struggles to put a tackle in on their striker  and when i do win the ball said striker with    tackling  immediately  wins the ball back  and  makes space from my defender  it s like the ai gets animations we the player doesn t   they  always  keep the ball when protecting it  no matter the attributes  you can t predict them when they re dribbling cos the game seems to read your inputs and reacts in nanoseconds  so they get by you or they ll just throw in some bs protect the ball animations  why do they always score the most bullshit goals that either my keeper should save or it should be blocked  speaking of blocking  they  always  block perfectly  yet my defenders will part like the red fucking sea   they  always  have an open man  always  especially in the final third  they get a man open who then doesn t miss  yet my players seem to  want  to be marked  there s no movement  it s fucking impossible to keep a clean sheet cos the ai  will  get a goal  you can be     up and cruising  but they ll god mode it up to your box and score in the   th minute of   added minutes because  fuck you    i  want  to enjoy playing cm  i used to put disgusting amounts of hours into it          years ago  but now the gameplay is just annoying  yes  sliders are a thing  i am using os sliders  but it doesn t combat a lot of the bullshit from the ai  because a lot of it isn t controlled by sliders  i have tried everything at this point to find a balance of fun yet realistic enough  but no combination works  lowering the difficulty just leads to absolutely braindead ai that you almost have to deliberately lose against  sliders or not  yet playing on a harder difficulty with sliders leads to god mode ai that  occasionally  misplace a pass and that s it    yes  i win more than i lose or draw  i ve been playing long enough  since      that i ve  worked out  the ai  but there s no actual  holy shit  moments in the matches anymore because you can t skin a few defenders and score  or put together a beautiful passing move or even win in the   th minute with a free kick or penalty  cos the ai just doesn t trip up and it s boring as fuck  there s no game winning blocks cos the ai only shoot when they re open and they  will  get open  or as i said before my player will move  my keeper is never the hero cos the ai will either blast the ball full power straight past him or the keeper will dive out the way   rant over  time for another break from fifa  maybe one day we ll get fun offline gameplay again    ;race_game;0.31349126950223594
   introduction  there s a lot of arguments about whether or not ai artists are truly artists  and they stem from a deeper discussion about whether ai art is truly art  in this post i m going to aim to convince you not only that ai art is art  but also that the people involved in creating that art are artists   this will be a long post  so get a coffee and hopefully it s informative or at least entertaining      defining our terms     defining  artist   the  cambridge dictionary   url  has three definitions for the word  artist       someone who paints  draws  or makes sculptures    someone who performs music    someone who creates things with great skill and imagination  i m going to be working with the third definition  which is mirrored in the first definition in  merriam webster   url      a person who creates art  such as painting  sculpture  music  or writing  using conscious skill and creative imagination  if we distil these definitions  there are two requirements for someone to be considered an artist      skill    imagination     defining  art   now  if we look at definitions for the word  art   noun   cambridge provides us with this definition      the making of objects  images  music  etc  that are beautiful or that express feelings    the activity of painting  drawing  and making sculpture    paintings  drawings  and sculptures    an activity through which people express particular ideas  it s interesting that none of these seem to be definitions for nouns but rather for the actions which produce those nouns   merriam webster defines  art   noun  more fluently in my opinion in its fourth definition      the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects    also  works so produced     the case to be made  given these definitions  i think it s fair to summarise that      an artist needs to have used creative imagination in the process    an artist needs to use skills which they have developed to produce aesthetic works    the works resulting from that combination of imagination  expression and skill are art  i don t think that most people would insist that one needs to be skilled at illustration or painting to be an artist  to do so would be to say that photographers  musicians  directors  composers and authors aren t artists   i will endeavor to demonstrate that skill is involved  but i m not interested in trying to demonstrate that those  specific  skills are involved  if the argument is that ai artists are not illustrators or painters  then there is no argument   i use stable diffusion as a tool  and i ll be using it to make my case here  in most examples i will generate eight images with the same parameters and pick the one i consider to be best  because i have a fairly low end gpu       mobile   i will generate less images on the more demanding applications using controlnet      demonstrating creative imagination  i think that creative imagination is the easiest point to demonstrate  but for the sake of completeness  i m going to start at the beginning      defining creativity  it may seem pointless to try to define  creativity   because we all know what it is  but that doesn t make it easy to put it into words   the  cambridge dictionary   url  describes creativity as  the ability to produce or use original and unusual ideas   and  merriam webster   url  describes it as  the ability to create  or  the quality of being creative   which in term is defined as  having the quality of something created rather than imitated  imaginative     to meet this definition  we should be able to demonstrate the following      it is possible for an ai artist to create something original  i e  not imitated      it is possible for an ai artist to create something unusual  i e  not commonly seen in real life    some would  wrongly  i believe  argue that the tool is the creator  but this argument could also be made for a camera  or indeed a drawing tablet or a pencil  in most cases  to create art a human needs to use some form of tool  a director needs actors and a film studio  a conductor needs an orchestra  a musician needs an instrument or a daw  in all of these cases  as with ai art  the tool doesn t create anything without human input      demonstrating originality  we can show that ai can create original concepts pretty easily  we just need to show that the output can be controlled to generate something new  this can be done with a simple prompt    model  ivoryv   prompt  i forgot the exact prompt but it was something like      masterpiece  best quality  detailed  detailed face    a painting of an old farmer holding to a tiny blue dragon  conversation  sitting on a bench  in the mountains  concept art  negative    worst quality  low quality    easynegative  sampler  dpm    m karras  steps       cfg scale       url   there are several fair arguments to make about this image    i didn t control the fine details at all  i didn t specify that i wanted a tree  the bench is broken  the hand holding the dragon is broken etc    which i will address later when i talk about skill   control  but the goal was to demonstrate originality and it is an original picture  reverse image searching the picture shows nothing particularly similar     demonstrating unusual ness  it would be fair to say that the image above is unusual  but let s go way out there and imagine an entirely different world  a food hall in ultra clean space station with metallic walls and floors  filled with greenery    model  scifi diffusion v    prompt    masterpiece  best quality  detailed  detailed    a photo inside a space station  restaurants  food court  bustling  metal walls  plants  greenery  busy  people  vendor stalls  marketplace  negative    worst quality  low quality    easynegative  sampler  euler a  sampling steps      cfg scale       url   i think it s fair to say that this is unusual  the juxtaposition of end game capitalism  space market  with all that greenery isn t a normal commentary on the future   if creativity is the art of creating something original or unusual  i would say that i ve done that  but that s the easier of the two points to prove     demonstrating skill  i ve seen a lot of poor argumentation on this topic from both sides   pro ai arguing that because something takes  time   that it takes  skill  is a poor argument  waiting for the paint to dry in my kitchen takes time  but waiting for paint to dry is not a skill  i will therefore not be arguing that time spent waiting equates to skill   similarly  i ve seen the argument that  this took a lot of effort  bandied around a lot  but effort is not skill  usually having greater skill reduces  not increases  required effort  i will therefore similarly not be arguing that working hard equates to skill   anti ai arguing that prompting can t be a skill because  it s just writing what you want in a box  fail to acknowledge that creative writing itself  is  a skill  and that prompting has a whole bunch of factors which can be learned in order to improve image generation   i intend to go much deeper than prompting in this post  but i reject the idea that prompting  isn t  a skill  it may not have a particularly high skill ceiling but those who practice it will achieve better results than those who don t     defining the challenge   merriam webster   url  defines skill as follows      the ability to use one s knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance    a learned power of doing something competently       a developed aptitude or ability  the  cambridge dictionary   url  has a more basic definition      an ability to do an activity or job well  especially because you have practised it  in order to demonstrate that skill is involved in creating ai art  i need to be able to show the following things are true      there are aspects of creating ai art  which when practised and studied  directly result in a higher quality image     there are aspects of creating ai art  which when practised and studied  directly result in the artist having greater control over the final image     skill involved in prompting  let s talk about prompting  a lot of people think prompting isn t a skill  and while i can t think of any time that i ve been able to get what i want from just prompting  i ve definitely observed the quality of my generations improving from more practice with prompting   let s say that we want to generate an image of a post apocalyptic city overrun by nature  similar to the effects seen in the last of us or parts of the fallout series   let s see what we can get with a very basic prompt    model  ivoryv   prompt    masterpiece  best quality  detailed    a post apocalyptic city overrun by nature  negative    worst quality  low quality    easynegative  sampler  euler a  sampling steps      cfg scale      url   this isn t a terrible example  some of the generations didn t have a lot of nature involved at all  and one had a mushroom cloud which is more apocalyptic than post apocalyptic  let s see if we can get more control over this image with prompting   let s say we want a sweeping shot showing more of the city  as if taken by a drone  we want more foliage  to put the apocalyptic event much further in history  and we want fungus taller than the buildings to be visible in the city  giving off a yellow mist of spores    model  ivoryv   prompt    masterpiece  best quality  detailed    a photo of a post apocalyptic city  foliage  moss

colorful mushrooms         contemporary    city   jungle    negative    worst quality  low quality    easynegative  futuristic  sci fi  sampler  euler a  sampling steps      cfg scale       url   i m not the most skilled prompter in the world  and you could probably debate whether you prefer the first or the second image  but i think it s clear that by using a few prompting tricks i achieved far greater control over this image than i had over the first   some of the more advanced prompting used here includes     weighting  getting a yellow mist was very challenging  but using a higher weight actually made it stick without turning all the buildings yellow    delay  by delaying  colorful mushrooms  to step    i was able to avoid the buildings being colourful as well    mixing  the mix of city jungle created a far more natural effect with the foliage    concept bleeding  the ai wanted to merge the buildings with the mushrooms  so i had to negative prompt  futuristic  and  sci fi  to avoid those strangely shaped buildings   i am in no way claiming that prompting is as  difficult  as learning to draw  only that it is a skill which can be improved to get closer to what you want     demonstrating deeper control over images  prompting alone is a great way to generate ideas  brainstorm  and reach starting points    but what if you want something really specific  prompting  no matter how well it s done  is not a consistent way to get anything from your mind s eye onto the screen     using img img   basic outlining  so how can we get more control  let s start by setting a scene using img img  we want this image set in a beautiful lagoon  hanging vines  waterfall etc  we could try prompting for the exact scene that we re imagining but we re unlikely to get it   the next step is to open up photoshop  well  in my case  gimp since i don t want to pay for photoshop  and either draw or photobash  or both  the scene we re imagining    quick sketch of what i want the scene to look like made with a mouse in gimp    url   for those who can t tell anything from this  i m looking for a rock face with two caves  a waterfall between the caves  and some foliage in front of and behind the rocks  i m specifically looking for foliage on the right and over the top to provide a  cozy  look by vignetting the entire image   i fed this into img img with a denoising strength of       essentially just keeping the basic colors and letting the sampler work with them to generate from the prompt  this is what i got back    model  ivoryv   prompt    masterpiece  best quality  photo background  detailed  photorealistic    a photo of a lagoon  jungle  saltwater lake    caves         waterfall  sand  realistic lighting  negative    worst quality  low quality    tree  easynegative  inside cave  sampler  dpm    m exponential  sampling steps       cfg scale       url   not bad  the second one is definitely the closest to what i was going for  but       using inpainting  i didn t ask for that many caves  or those rocks in the water  so now we go back to gimp and work on it some more    re edited in gimp    url   touched up  re adding the pillar between the caves  removing the water rocks and thickening part of the waterfall   this time  we go to the inpaint tab  we don t want to change the entire image  so we re going to tell stablediffusion to only repaint the parts that we ve changed  leaving plenty of space around those areas so that we don t get weird artifacts   we ll turn the de noising strength down to     because we don t want to lose shapes  only add surface details  here s what we get from this    after inpainting  same settings as above    url   obviously  you could do more steps of inpainting to remove or add anything you want  and tweak the image as much as you want  but the point of this is only to demonstrate compositional control  and we ve achieved that     adding characters to the scene using controlnet  we could attempt to prompt characters into the scene with inpainting  but it s very unlikely that we d get the characters we want in the pose that we want  enter controlnet   i used a pre made pose on  posemy art   url  for this  normally i d pose them myself to get full control of the composition  but this post has taken a few hours to write and i d like to get the dog out for a walk   and exported depth maps   openpose references    openpose map   url    depth map   url   i then inpainted a large area around where the characters are on the pma references as well as the leaf in the foreground because it would overlap the characters  and honestly i really don t like how it looks   and set the denoising strength back up to      to regenerate the area wholesale  i did a simple update to the prompt and here are the results     model  ivoryv   prompt    masterpiece  best quality  photo background  detailed  photorealistic    a photo of a lagoon  a man holding a woman in the air  jungle  saltwater lake    caves         waterfall  sand  realistic lighting  negative    worst quality  low quality    tree  easynegative  inside cave  moss  sampler  dpm    m exponential  sampling steps       cfg scale        url   messy  but the second one is looking pretty promising  we ll need to re add our vignette using inpainting  but that s going to be easier than rolling for the right pose over and over   what if we want fine grained control over the characters though  there are two options  if we want to use well defined existing characters  we can use loras  along with the composable lora plugin   but for this example  we re not looking to use any specific characters     demonstrating control of characters using latent couple  an artist doesn t want the ai deciding who the characters in their picture are  so let s be a lot more specific using the latent couple plugin  we re going to have a white guy in speedos and a hispanic woman in a bikini   you could be a lot more specific if you wanted to  or use loras  but this is enough detail to illustrate the point  and my laptop gpu really doesn t love using   controlnet tabs   latent couple at the same time   set the denoising strength down to      and this is what we get    model  ivoryv   prompt    masterpiece  best quality  photo background  detailed  photorealistic    a photo of a lagoon  a man holding a woman in the air  jungle  saltwater lake    caves         waterfall  sand  realistic lighting and a photo of a white man  human  caucasian  short hair  wearing blue speedos and a photo of a hispanic woman  human  hispanic  long black hair  wearing a   bikini         negative    worst quality  low quality    tree  easynegative  inside cave  moss  sampler  dpm    m exponential  sampling steps       cfg scale       url   that didn t work out great  it added an extra head in most of the pics  my depth map is too small to be read well   and ignored half of the prompts  so i went back into gimp  manually tidied some stuff  played with controlnet weights  brushed back in my old vignette leaf and did a couple more rounds of inpainting to get a result i was happier with    same settings as above    url   the people are still far from perfect  if i had better photoshop skills  this would be the time when i d clean them up too  alas  another skill which would benefit my ai art is    digital painting  and that s really my point  while i have some skills and some understanding of the process  my work is still amateur and has a lot of areas that need improvement     skills needed to succeed with stable diffusion  so  what skills have we demonstrated      we ve demonstrated that good prompting allows for more control over an image  but that prompting alone will only take you so far     we ve demonstrated that just like other forms of art  an understanding of good composition is important to create a good final image  this means that skills like depth perception  colour theory and composition theory are still relevant to ai artists     we ve demonstrated that being able to draw paint to at least a minimal degree enables far better control of how the images look  the better you can draw  the better results you ll be able to get out of sd    if i could draw a half decent lagoon scene  i wouldn t have to rely so much on denoising   randomness     we ve demonstrated that a good ability to pose  and make   d models enables greater control over generated images  there are a whole bunch of skills around training   improving loras that i haven t touched on     we ve demonstrated that i lack the skills necessary to get the best out of latent couple  and that someone would need more skill than i have to get quality character designs without loras  which makes sense because i usually use loras    in short  there are skills which can be practiced and studied which directly lead to better images  ai art is demonstrably a skill based and creative activity     in summary  we have demonstrated that originality and unusualness are possible  that stable diffusion responds to  your  creativity  and that understanding its various components and plugins is necessary to get good results with it   if we define  as we did at the start  art as the intersection of human creativity and human skill  then ai artists are artists  and ai art is art   if we try to change the definitions to require the skill specifically to include drawing or painting  then digital artists  photographers  scuptors  and musicians aren t artists   it s fair to say that ai artists aren t illustrators  or painters  or photographers  it s fair to say that some of the skills involved are easier to learn than others  for example  digital painting with an undo button is much easier than traditional painting where you have to improvise when you mess up    there are differences between the arts  but that doesn t make some of them arts and others not ;ai_art;0.11885381560770292
i ve been hovering between ai wars and defending ai art reddit for some time now  and i kept quiet unless there was a post i felt i could contribute to  however  with the recent death of the famed magna artist akira toriyama and the general hate coming from the anti ai community towards people showing support and inspiration to the dbz series by making ai art of the franchise s characters  i felt it was time to speak out as the death threats and general discrimination disinformation should be unacceptable in today s digital world  as a professional artist who has worked within the video game and media spaces  i want to contribute to the debate by providing a grounded response and insights that many don t know regarding the art world and its gatekeepers      please note this post is mainly my opinions and personal experiences  this will not reflect everyone       before i begin  i want to address the typical anti ai artist s usual community response   yes  i have and continue to pick up a pencil stylus when needed   i have a bfa in digital animation  a minor in film studies  and a master s in game design and interactive media  focusing on business development and dei  diversity  equity  inclusion      x   b    in       during my art studies in digital illustration   url     x   b    from late       using traditional oil painting to create a  ren  magritte inspired art piece   url     x   b    character design study       inspired by missingno glitch   url   so  hopefully  the above showcases   yes  i ve picked up a pencil and used it to make art   however  the dark side of obtaining an art based degree s  is that the turnover of graduates tends to be high  and they don t end up working in their designated industry  my bfa in digital animation was a first generation class  out of the    students  only two moved forward with professional industry careers  my master s was a fifth generation class  and only one student managed to move forward with a relevant industry career  i bring this up because it creates a jaded effect among those practicing digital art in any form  resulting in a mentality of  if i draw hard enough  i ll be good as          and            the reality is that individuals will self punish themselves before seeking tools to improve their weaknesses  grow further with their foundational skill sets  and level up their artistic abilities  with ai  though  that  tool  became a reality that many of my former university peers rejected in favor of continuing to struggle financially and visually with their learned artistic skills  this isn t mentioning the core of the problem among the anti generative ai hate   artistic gatekeepers   who affect the influence of both generalists and people outside the art world bubble     artistic gatekeepers    these tend not to be professional artists but those from backgrounds adjacent to the arts  they seek to keep levels and skills at moderate ranges to create community growth over individual growth  i e   a pact mentality growth they are responsible for developing and a style consistent among the entire group  usually  by toxic means  they prevent artists from achieving similar levels of skill growth to professionals by providing antiquated ideologies such as   draw every day by doing x and y  focus on your figure drawing by reading this and that  oh  you do anime  hell  no study realism to do            and generally discriminatory communications to put down any artistic growth using harassment and shaming  at first  some of these points are logical responses until the individual only refers to these points without providing further feedback or guidance to get that person further up in their artistic abilities  the gateekerp have yet to achieve this level  thus  they are gatekeeping themselves and the young artists from ever reaching professional levels until the cycle is broken  i speak from personal experience  as i was gatekept and gaslighted from my artistic progression from the early days of digital art by traditionalists and amateurs through my college years  i sought immense growth but was thrown around by early discord mods and paywalls to seek that knowledge to level up  i reached a burnout state from all of this during my early master s years and took time to focus on other things when the toxicity got so high  then the pandemic hit  and i found myself drawing and sketching more often again  but with little to no interaction with the art community due to those previous toxic burns     x   b   flash forward to       an early ai happened     x   b    shadow lugia early gen art      dream artworks   url   at this point  i had just finished my master s degree  was working in the digital media industry  and generally kept the focus on technology moving into the art world  i learned about ai art through social media posts of this abstract artwork approach  artists at the time laughed at how these pieces of work would never touch them regarding visual development  however  for the common joe  this was a godsend for creating visually appealing artwork for their homes and computer screens instead of buying commissioning an artist for it  for reference    and a lot of people don t know this        artists in the education and professional fields have been aware of ai tools being developed for creative work for a very long time  still  they just blew it off as the early generative tools that did not impede their work  many young students and early professionals primarily focused on character art  concept art  and some graphic design  only a few wanted to do background art and any super technical artwork they tended to avoid    at least from my own observations during under grad    so  with ai art at this time being highly abstract  young artists professionals downgraded the subject to mere fads and refocused their frustrations on nfts and cryptocurrencies as they were overpopulated and scamming many vocal artists during              irony  this is probably why anti ai communities try to compare generative ai to nfts as it was their focal for several years  and rightfully so as that scam affected many upon many lives        however  back to the initial point  ai art was starting  i got involved because i was very excited about the artistic possibilities this could bring to my creative background  correcting general educational flaws and expressing the style visual language i wanted for my work     x   b    world of warcraft tuskarr  novel ai   digital painting        url     x   b    world of warcraft zandalari  stable diffusion late        url   so  in       novel ai introduced its image generator  and the first race for character based image generators began  midjourney and stable diffusion became vital tools for creatives to use when discussing what artwork can become with ai  i was thrilled to see these tools become accessible and began incorporating ai into my workflow  i learned prompt and c  coding languages to help me create my own ai generative tools for my artwork  i gained clients for ai commission artwork  built up a small social media following through discord  and felt incredibly empowered  my artistic education is linked well with ai tools to identify color  visual appeal  and correct figure form  i wasn t just making a cute  sexy anime girl  i made a variety of fantasy races  pushed the ai to learn how to create world of warcraft races   that were taxing on ai learning    and was on a creative high  debates were also starting regarding how these ai tools were trained  and misinformation and early hate were sprouting up  i found myself in the crossfire as people were generally excited about my work  except for traditional digital artists who refused to pick up the ai tools   at least publicly    artists i knew were incredibly afraid that their publicly facing artwork was used to train many of these models  and some lashed out at these tools as they watched their commissions dry up     my stance on style loras    so  for those who may or may not know  the other side of this debate does have merit  it is spoken only sometimes among the pro ai community but should be heard  during mid      and early       loras entered the ai scene  being a tool to hyper focus specific characters  backgrounds  ideas  and  styles  for ai generations  the first three are manageable as they are general concepts and  when copyrights are involved  lean towards fan art to support their fandoms  a lot of the artistic critique about ai was that it couldn t focus on specific ideas and thus was pushed out on that point  however  the lora artist style models directly target artists for their visual style  now  yes  style isn t copyrighted  nor should it be for the fair marketplace  however  targetting an artist and or anti ai artist who had been vocal about their feelings regarding their publicly facing work being used to train big name ai models and creating loras focused on their identities  was way too far  i joined a group of ai artists who went towards a more ethical model development approach and continue to support artists wherever i humanly can  that doesn t mean i support anti ai recent activities and comments  nor will i stop using ai for my creative process  still  i support artists on subjects like style stealing  which should be banned  and i focus more on ai artists establishing their style trained through individual custom ais made by them for themselves     x   b   in       i experienced a significant divide on the internet regarding ai artwork  much at the same level as digital artwork in the early     s  i was forced into a corner by some hyper protective discord mods regarding ai artwork  lynchpins on some communities that had very little artwork regarding their franchises  and  in very few cases  insulted when i was asked to put my ai artwork into the meme channels of these discords  thankfully  my client work grew  and i made some fantastic character artwork for given franchises  that said  i also attempted to help bridge my old classmates from undergrad to ai generative tools  they outright rejected it and returned to harsh living conditions without growth in their artistic abilities and content  they sincerely believe in the same toxic gatekeeping culture i was brought into during my undergrad years  now evolving to focus heavily on rejecting ai usage for creative development  devolving from  you can use ai for reference and tracing to learn  to  you cannot use ai for tracing  you need to do that by hand  to finally   how dare you use ai   and for me  that is not even the worst of it  my clients end up getting hated by some anti ai communities when posting the artwork they paid for and are proud of getting the same  if not worse  commentary by communities that deeply believe in the gatekeeper commentaries that targeted young digital artists and now ai artists  by the end of       i watched and communicated with discord mods who had become hyper protective of the artists in their servers  new channels having to be made to keep the peace  and sometimes even banns or my departure from their servers by hypocritical mentalities affecting my showing of artwork i created     x   b    blood elf fanart at the end of        url     akira toriyama events and my reason for speaking out    i have followed the developments and community between pro ai and anti ai  i am pro ai because of what it can bring to creative growth and opportunities to be even more effective in the creative space  but i will always support artist livelihoods as they evolve to use these tools to improve their works   if willing   and encourage protections for their private and paid wall facing work  with copyright laws coming into effect soon for ai artwork to be given guidance on copyright protection  these events will define the nature of creativity and its direction for future generations  so i m fully invested in everything around me regarding generative ai     x   b   that said  i won t tolerate and am speaking out about the fact that these gatekeepers have created an eldritch monster of hate toward any creative speech and general appreciation for any fandom and individuals  with the passing of the dbz creator  akira toriyama  and how influential they were to the modernization of anime  it is incredibly fitting for ai artwork to be made in support because he pushed many of our modern techniques in mediums of graphical manga art  many young  now more middle aged artists grew up with dbz  and now being able to celebrate this man s life in any medium of their choice should be celebrated  not targeted for death threats and bigotry  sure  there is ugly ai artwork  as much as ugly hand drawn art  but the level of hate through gatekeepers  ignorance is the natural source of this problem     x   b   as a professional speaking to the anti ai community  i understand your hate and anger  however  you can retrace the steps from where you obtained your opinions and reevaluate them  if what i ve told you through my own experiences of the days before ai has stuck  i hope you can see that the source of this initial generative ai hate isn t as black and white as it is typically depicted through articles and one sided opinions   as for the pro ai community  we don t have to tolerate aggressive behaviors and continual hyper protective mentalities  you do have the right to show your work freely and without hate  yes  you should develop your visual style in your work  but you should also be free to express love and passion for people with whatever tools you want  that is true inclusivity for everyone to learn to do   i want to end this post with a quote from master roshi of dragon ball z  whom i take inspiration from regarding his carefree mentality    but you will not go in there with hopes of winning the tournament the first time you compete    to do so would be arrogant  and arrogance is for fools  not warriors    so you will enter the tournament with the sole purpose of improving your fighting skills   arrogance should never be tolerated  and speaking up will help inspire others to do the same so that we can be creative and continually inspired to make fantastic art     tdlr        i m a professional artist with industry experience  yes  i ve picked up a pencil to obtain multiple degrees     i watched my college classmates fail miserably to enter the creative field  which creates jaded mentalities towards innovation in the arts by technology     art schools and their communities  discord reddit  have  artistic gatekeepers  who spiral terms they struggle with and enforce for failed states in artistic growth     i have a history with ai and how it evolved through the     s thus far  i disapprove of artist style loras and feel they target artists rather than support them     the transformation of social media for ai art posting and the hypersensitivity that emerged at the end of last year     my thoughts about these death threats from anti ai communities toward people posting ai artwork for their love of the dbz creator are that they are in the wrong and need to reflect on where they are coming from with their hate  the pro ai community has the right to post any artwork in any medium supporting the franchise they grew up with  that should be common sense ;ai_art;0.12959739714374469
 okay so i can t edit title  but what i mean is that the ai rarely actually seems to play the game well      so this is a list  off the top of my head  of problems the ai has that make them play weaker and weaker every patch  this has nothing to do with actual battle difficulty  but rather their weakness in creating strong empires capable of putting out strong armies         build their settlements really stupidly  spend their money on walls and stupid buildings instead of having a template for how to build like a normal person  has the following issues     often unable to build high tier units   often unable to get new powercreeped dlc units   often unable to build an actual army composition since they have     high tier recruit buildings at best  anyone ever see the famed    giants stack          often don t even use their faction s special abilities  or don t use them intelligently     skeven spam  menace from below  at the start of battle  before battle lines have even met  waste their ability entirely  when they could be rendering artillery archers useless mid battle    orcs can t even waaaagh   ikit claw uses his doomrocket in interesting ways   many faction abilities used haphazardly or just in silly way  too many to list         skill their leaders like imbeciles  i know it d be a lot to go through at this point  probably      lords lls to do  but you need to have a template for how ai skill their lords  maybe attach it to campaign difficulty     ai won t red line their infantry  meaning legendary bonuses are overshadowed by turn       i know not every faction needs to do this  but most do  reducing legendary bonuses in game    but then not making them smarter to buffing their melee  means ai melee lines are actually weaker than player melee lines now consistently  and by a good amount    often picks ridiculous things like recruitment cost as a legendary ai   results in lords that are super weak  even if they can out level you a bit early game         not really their lack of game mechanics  but just something the ai does that makes the game super easy  they suicide their leveled lords constantly and end up only having level   lord spam by mid game  lords are powerful  and level   lords are a completely wash  the ai needs some way to either bring out higher level lords baseline later in the game  or they need immortality earlier         ai refuses to actually take cities like a normal human being     they will sack a city repeatedly    they will watch a city from a distance while raiding   they will raze cities they were perfectly capable of taking    they will siege a city that had no ability to put up a real fight against them   they will take      turns to take a few cities at the edge of your borders  when they could have just barreled in and trashed your side    they will take forever to expand  because they re spending so much time doing nothing    i understand this is likely done so players don t get bricked campaigns so easily  but on higher difficulties  maybe just add legendary  at this point   the ai should actually punish and obliterate you for leaving a flank open         i can t tell if this is my feeling or how it actually works  but it feels like legendary isn t getting bonuses to the newer resources  the ai is obviously less capable than the player and needs help here  they get things like bonus scrap from total warhammer    but things past the middle of tw  they don t seem to do well  ikit doesn t seem to get rat marines  i haven t seen the jade dragon be strong either despite being an s  faction  something just feels off here         vampire counts ai feels like it was neutered pretty hard by ca awhile ago  and while they are still an insanely strong campaign faction  it definitely feels legendary vampires are being reigned in     with all the bonuses legendary gives  we should see    stacks of higher tier vampire units prancing across the landmasses  but instead we mostly see low tier crap stacks  and not even that many of them  while   vlad can do okay  it s not even close to where his strength should be  he s only about as powerful as a player played vc  definitely not a full powered legendary difficulty  with the above difficulties expanding  he can slowly eat empire but never becomes a game ending threat  legendary difficulty is supposed to be insanely difficult  if people can t handle     cities vlad at turn    then they should go to a lower difficulty  i know this is a bit preachy     with empire getting giga buffed  i think letting the vc off the reigns and letting them actually just use their legendary bonuses to amass tons of grave guard monsters  if empire wins the duel they will have tons of higher tier stacks than vc can make    i suspect a problem might be the ai straight up doesn t realize where they can go to raise dead   which even the player has a difficulty at knowing  since it s still a broken ui     i also suspect ca just limits what the vc are allowed to do to limit player annoyance  again though  and i know this sounds preachy  people should play on an easier difficulty if they can t handle giga vcs         i m not sure the warriors of chaos are functioning properly for an ai at all  i m not really sure what to say here  woc is a top tier faction with tons of potential  yet played by the ai they don t seem to do much at all  i don t think they use the    attack for marauders  or get many stacks at all  i m not sure they re even upgrading their units properly         cathay is a mess  legendary cathay should have like    armies of high powered jade warriors by turn     and yet in game we re looking at maybe   good stacks  and some peasants  i have no idea what the ai is possibly doing wrong here   just about the only ai that seems to be properly playing on the campaign is greenskins  unfortunately  since they don t scale well as a faction  it s pretty easy to outscale them as basically anyone and gun down their armies    i have to format this without a   after the numbers  which looks really bad  but if i add the   it formats it super bad on reddit  ;escape_tarkow;0.37310374629758575
tww players have some justified complaints   the ai is a coward that runs away leading to a series of unfulfilling and most commonly autoresolved minor settlement battles and sieges  no fun battles with our awesome fantasy armies  just boring autoresolves and mediocre siege battles against underwhelming garrisons  then it attacks with an army that s taking attrition  contrary to what some may say this is not  smart  on behalf of the ai  and no one ever even makes the argument that this is fun  because it s not   another complaint  which goes hand in hand with the first one  is that there are too many sieges and not enough field battles   a third complaint is the pacing of the campaign  the beginning is where the challenge  and fun  is  some people quit as early as turn      i have already won   they say  and they re right  too  this is a common complaint in strategy games  at some point the player has  won   no other power in the game poses a threat anymore  this is inevitable  but it doesn t have to happen so soon   these three problems      ai running     siege battles too common and no field battles     bad campaign pacing   won and boring after turn     all have the same root cause in my estimation  that being how sieges work in wh   and i don t just mean the battles themselves  i m also talking about the campaign mechanics surrounding them and their general place in the gameplay loop      why is the ai running  because it is outmatched and needs time to prepare the necessary forces to counter the player     because of    the ai is running  what is the players next move  take the ais settlements  duh  result  siege after siege after siege  ad infinitum     player easily expands cause the ai doesn t offer meaningful resistance  player becomes much too powerful much too quickly  boring  next campaign   as you can see this is all related  and what is the root cause   instant siege attacks   hear me out on this ok   why can t the ai gather it s forces to offer meaningful resistance to the player  because if the ai takes   turns to recruit  gather its troops the player will likely take as many settlements as the amount of turns it takes multiplied by the amount of armies the player is attacking with   even with economy and recruitment capacity cheats this is not a winning strategy for the ai   but it doesn t have to be this way   in reality actual siege battles are rare  siege attacks are costly in money and men  and the less you prepare  siege engines  scouting attacks etc   the worse you will suffer if you attack   but what does the defender even hope to accomplish  just try to inconvenience the enemy  no  they are waiting  but for what  reinforcements   and what will that lead to  an open field battle   ok so in reality the besieging army is far more likely to get the hell out of there if their commander thinks they are about to be attacked while they are besieging a castle city because it puts them at a disadvantage   you get where i m going with this  yeah  the people that are attacked have time to gather troops  sufficient troops to oppose their enemy in the open field   there is a game that does this  age of wonders    it takes time to prepare for a siege assaults in that game  sometimes   or more turns depending on what fortifications the city has and what besieging equipment magic  abilities you have access to   and let me tell you  this has led to some of the most fun open field battles  i have ever had in a strategy game   age of wonders also has field and siege battles as separate types   yes  you read that right  not siege battles  open field battles   why  because the ai has the time to gather its troops  and boy does it ever  in aow  you have stacks of   units    such stacks can fight on each side in any one battle  i have had the ai throw     stacks  in successive battles  at my besieging troops before   we could have something like that in this game  but not if we insist on being able to attack any walled city on turn   because our lord is a siege attacker or we have artillery etc   i told you there would be downsides   but it would solve  or rather mitigate  those three problems      the ai only runs to gather up it s troops and engage you in massive field battles     sieges will be rarer  you will have more massive field battles     player expansion will be slowed considerably  it will take longer to reach the  no one can beat me anyways  stage of a campaign   but it comes at the cost of a slower campaign  many players would probably hate that  people only have so much time to spend playing videogames   and just removing the siege attacker trait wouldn t be sufficient  not even close  it may seem like a small change but there are many downstream effects  so that takes massive amounts of dev time and money  probably necessitating a dlc to pay for it   now going into detail on all the other things i would do to spice up sieges would make this post even longer  and most of them would just be copied and adapted from aow  which does sieges really well imo  others would be taken from eltharion s vortex campaign     tl dr  a root cause of the big complaints in the title is our ability to instantly attack in sieges  both history and age of wonders   can give hints on how to make sieges and everything surrounding them better  but it will have the downsides of a slowed campaign and being a lot of work for the devs  and they would need to make money of off such changes   as with most things in life it s a trade off     what do you think   am i a combination of your favorite video game maker  whom i have supplanted in your opinion as the new     and the smartest historian and strategist because of this analysis   or am i an idiot whose ideas would ruin the game you love and who shouldn t even be allowed on the internet   ;escape_tarkow;1.0
