1c0xi7a;i m looking for guidance on creating a multi agent conversational ai that can dynamically switch between specialized agents based on the user s needs while retaining the full conversation history to provide a personalized experience the high level idea is when the user asks a question or makes a request the conversational ai analyzes the input to determine which specialized agent is best suited to assist e g a math agent for solving math problems a history agent for discussing historical topics etc the relevant specialized agent then engages with the user to address their specific query throughout the conversation even as different specialized agents kick in the full chat history is retained and passed along so each agent has the full context of the conversation this allows the conversational ai to provide a seamless experience that is personalized to the user s ongoing needs i m fairly new to working with tools like langchain and could use any advice or best practices for architecting and orchestrating something like this some specific questions what s the best way to structure the specialized agents should they be separate fine tuned models separate knowledge bases that plug into foundational models gpt or something else how can i efficiently store and pass along the full conversation history to each agent without hitting token limits of the underlying models are there any existing open source projects or frameworks that could serve as a good starting point or reference for orchestrating a conversational ai like this any guidance or resources are much appreciated i m excited to dive into this but could use a push in the right direction let me know if any additional details would be helpful;0

1ea0pbz;about a year ago i started a business in a very niche area doing some really interesting stuff with ai it took me about months to get it to a point where it was ready to go live which we did back in january since then we ve grown from nothing to having several thousand customers now and generating nearly a month in subscription revenue we re growing month over month all of our customers are consumers but we re starting to get phone calls from businesses which we re not super well equipped to handle but could if we made it a priority we spend almost no money on marketing the product sells itself as soon as someone sees it we offer a free hour trial of people who try it subscribe immediately we have no real competitors our tech is very unique and i suspect many have tried to duplicate it and failed i expect our growth to continue at the current pace for at least another year and then i think it will slowly taper back to maybe month over month assuming we opt not to enter any new markets there is enormous opportunity to use this same tech in adjacent industries but it would require a lot of sales marketing work to break into those markets this business was showing so much promise that back in march i left my job where i was making a year as a tech executive so that i could focus on this full time i ve now got a solid roadmap a wonderful and loyal customer base and an incredible growth trajectory but i m tired and burned out and i d love either sell the whole company or sell a chunk of it to an investor that would bring in enough capital to let us hire a few more people except i haven t got a clue how to even begin to find someone who might be interested in this i d love any advice should i be looking for a vc angels how do i even start the search does the normal valuation rule apply here of maybe x revenue for the ebidta numbers i m showing or does my month over month growth give me a boost;1

190f9mm;as a background i did this exercise for computer vision a few years ago when the dgx was new at that point the data load characteristics were an initial brief minute iirc spike in data reads of around gib sec followed by a long fairly sustained load of about mib at the time most data storage vendors used marketing rhetoric that ai needed the fastest possible storage systems measured in per node performance over gib sec but my calculations showed that much much less expensive systems with much more attractive price performance characteristics with a peak throughput of around gib sec would increase training time for those computer vision models by about minutes over a hour training run its been a while so those figures might be out but they re still indicative my thesis at the time was that the money saved on more modest data storage and networking could be better allocated towards more gpu and memory having said that this was three years ago and llm s are not computer vision so i thought i d look to see if hpc style i o architectures are really justified for llm training in the same way they are for things like weather modelling or if the must have the fastest storage because faster goodest is just a hangover of hpc style thinking combined with hardware vendor incentives to sell the most expensive option in the interests of full disclosure i work for a storage vendor and my findings at the time were somewhat inconvenient i am now in a better position to promote a more balanced narrative hence my revisiting of this old research;0

191que7;to begin with i understand that the term ai is overused and overly broad and that most things dubbed ai are in reality machine learning algorithms ie fancy statistics i studied machine learning in undergrad specializing in natural language processing but i also took a class on other forms of ai i don t remember most of it but am vaguely familiar with the subject however i don t know anything about game development though i know that game ai is a distinct thing from the kinds of ml algorithms i m more familiar with i know that you can t just jury rig chatgpt to play strategy games but i am wondering why the innovations we have seen in the last decade in nlp image generation and things like uber pricing haven t really translated to comparable advancements in video game ai i m guessing that the usual algorithms games are built on are distinct enough from these other things that there isn t any applicability to each other in my ai class we learned about minimax and had to write a program to win mancala which is fairly trivial but i assume the principle is the same as more advanced games something like that requires solving every possible end state which i understand isn t feasible for most games i also understand that a unique challenge is making game ai good but not too good because otherwise it would be impossible to beat however i still don t fully understand why there hasn t been more success developing game ai that is challenging while still fun to play against to me both of these point to the benefits of more probabilistic based models maybe this is a stupid question but why isn t it possible to use human player activity to train a game model in a similar way that large language models are trained on a corpus of written text you don t need to create game rules for every possible permutation of decisions but can instead learn to approximate the general patterns that a successful player would make in a given situation i understand that this would be insanely complicated especially for certain types of game but is it just a matter of complexity or cost or is there a more technical reason why it s not possible i do know that there has been some research done on this with starcraft but these have been academic models used to solve the game rather than something companies use for their base product if it s a matter of ai s developed like this being so good that they re not fun to play against why isn t it possible to model behavior on more mediocre players to introduce unoptimal play that s more organic and immersive than the ai just doing something obvious stupid;2

1b1s4nl;i don t think pure text video will be the workhorse of the film industry in times to come it seems to me that video video is going to be the actual tool of the trade at least until the ai models can eat entire books and spit a complete movie in a single shot video to video will likely either solve or substantially diminish the problems of wrong physics and extra limbs it will also give great creative control and flexibility however keeping objects consistent beyond seconds will likely require additional ai sub models for each object similar to lora or dreambooth for stable diffusion which is labor and resource intensive ultimately if video generators develop to solve object consistency over hour long time spans they will likely result on the cgi side on a more realistic render engine that converts rough video to finished video and on the vfx side on less overall video editing work crucially it already has proven the capability of keep frame to frame and object consistency at least up to seconds interpolation between two videos extrapolation backwards and forwards of a video the catch is that unless the model can be fed book length prompts and output movie length videos in one go both cgi and vfx video video pipelines will come at the expense of creating ai sub models for each object that needs to remain consistent across several minutes maybe what will happen over time is that people will start creating libraries of video ai sub models and selling those individual objects much like d artists sell models today or how videographers sell stock footage there will be a wolf model a th century firearm model a keyboard model and so on the workflow would be to assign these descriptors to rough d shapes or physical props in the set and then tie it all together with global text prompts and feed it along the original rough video so that the ai spits out versions of the final thing to be chosen and comped instead of d models and d rigs we could start seeing the development of specialized ai primitives inside of a d environment something like sd s controlnet with open pose but in d and animated across time an animation ai will move the rig a model ai will instruct the appearance of the object and a general video video ai will produce the final product as to what is going to happen to the job market i believe that unlike what happened in the d art realm we will have the creation of as many jobs as those that are lost this seems like a crazy uninformed and high on copium take but hear me out at the same time that producing a movie becomes cheaper and big studios start scaling down and;0
