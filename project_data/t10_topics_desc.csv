0;0;9999;7821;9999;   tldr     we built a fully autonomous  ai generated blog that ranked and got website visitors    full case study with pictures       url   so  let s dive into something pretty cool i worked on a little over   months ago  a series of nextjs apps that are not your average blogs  these are fully autonomous  ai generated blogs  think of it as blending cutting edge web technology with a dash of ai wizardry  in this case study  i m going to walk you through how this idea came to life  the nuts and bolts of building it  and all the awesome things i learned along the way     why automated blogging     in       i developed a blog that quickly gained traction  amassing over   million page views  it became my full time job for a period  immersing me in the world of seo  however  as i gradually moved away from the seo scene  i observed an intriguing trend coinciding with the emergence of gpt  google s search rankings were undergoing noticeable fluctuations  and the blogging community was visibly perturbed  it appeared that google was struggling to filter through an influx of low quality content   this observation sparked a new idea  what if i could leverage openai s apis to fully automate the creation of blog posts  the goal was ambitious  to generate full length  valuable blog posts that could ascend in search rankings autonomously  armed with a few new domains  and the best droplets    can buy  i embarked on this experimental venture  the aim was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of automated blogs in a landscape that was rapidly evolving     nextjs and openai  the winning combination    when it came to choosing the right tools for this project  i had some clear objectives in mind  efficiency  seo friendliness  and top notch content generation  this led me to the winning combination of nextjs and openai      nextjs  a game changer for blogging       server side rendering  ssr  and revalidation     one of the key reasons for opting for nextjs was its capability for server side rendering and the revalidation feature  this meant i could add new statically generated blog posts seamlessly  without the constant need for redeployments  in a dynamic blogging landscape  this functionality was not just a convenience  it was a necessity for keeping the content fresh and up to date     seo advantages     nextjs is renowned for its seo benefits  given that the core purpose of these blogs was to rank well on search engines  leveraging nextjs s seo friendly features was a no brainer  from faster load times to optimized indexing by search engines  nextjs provided the solid foundation needed to make these blogs stand out in search results     choosing openai for content creation    when it came to content generation  i wanted nothing but the best  openai s language models are at the forefront of ai technology  their capability to produce coherent  contextually relevant  and engaging content made them the ideal choice for this project  by harnessing the power of openai s models  i was able to automate the creation of blog posts that weren t just filler text  but valuable content with the potential to engage readers and drive traffic   combining the technical prowess of nextjs with the advanced language capabilities of openai created a synergy that was essential for the success of this automated blogging venture   built with     nextjs    web framework    postgresql    database management    tailwindcss    styling framework    prismajs    database orm    the ai blogging strategy  focusing on listicles    when it came to deciding the type of content the ai should focus on  i settled on listicles for several compelling reasons         high search volume     listicles are a goldmine in terms of search volume  they draw a large audience and frequently appear in search results dominated by low domain authority  da  sites  this presents a unique opportunity to penetrate a market with content that s not only popular but also situated in a competitive space where standing out is still achievable         ai content generation constraints     working with ai generated content can be unpredictable  without specific guidance  an ai tasked with writing a simple recipe might suddenly switch to explaining python programming  listicles  with their structured  straightforward nature  mitigate this risk  they offer a clear  concise framework that ai can follow more reliably  ensuring the content remains on topic  this format is ideal for ai generated blogging as it maintains both relevance and coherence         large language models perform great for listicle queries     looking to the future  i believe that the way people search for listicle type content  such as baby name ideas  is poised to undergo a significant transformation  large language models are exceptionally adept at crafting personalized listicles  often surpassing the results found in search results  serps   within the next five years  i expect most searches for this type of content to pivot towards large language models rather than conventional search engines  this foresight into search trends adds another layer of strategic value to focusing on listicles     design and architecture  crafting an autonomous yet quality driven blogging system    the architecture of my automated blogging system is designed to balance autonomy with the generation of high quality content  the system revolves around a central database and a series of ai driven scripts and functions  working in tandem to create and optimize blog posts     central database  the foundation    the system is anchored by a central database that holds vital information such as blog topics  categories  and other essential details necessary for crafting blog posts  this database acts as the starting point for the content generation process   the database is postgresql  hosted on digital ocean     the automated content creation workflow          topic selection     a cron job script selects a topic from the database for each new post         crafting the post     the script uses the topic  category  and keywords to begin crafting the post  blending ai with structured data         utilizing multiple ai assistants     different ai assistants generate specific sections of the post  such as intro paragraphs  seo optimized titles  and subheadings  ensuring content quality and relevance         outline to full content     ai generated outlines are expanded into full blog posts         efficient ai image generation and hosting     images are created using the dall e api and uploaded from the server to imagekit via their api for dynamic resizing and optimization to be done on the front end  these imagekit urls are then stored in the database for use on the blog posts         the humanizer function     a function refines ai content to appear more natural  employing nlp techniques like paraphrasing  sentence simplification  and text stylization  this is to try to bypass some ai detection tools   this typescript snippet showcases the various layers of processing  including paraphrasing  sentence simplification  text stylization  grammar checks  and even the intentional scattering of rare typos to mimic human like imperfections          function to convert ai content to human like content export async function

simplicity and ai into blogging    the foundation of the blogging system was a straightforward nextjs application  designed with simplicity and functionality in mind  the application included several essential features to create a user friendly experience     blog display     a clean and intuitive interface for visitors to read the ai generated listicles     comment functionality     an interactive feature allowing visitors to engage with the content     about the author section     to add a personal touch and credibility  even though it was ai generated     category pages     for easy navigation and better organization of the blog posts     seo enhancements     implemented to ensure the blogs rank well in search engines     markov generators     implemented a markov generator that read the ai content and allowed users to generate unique names  this worked surprisingly well most of the time    personalizing the blogs    the decision to make every aspect of the blogs   from content to author personas   ai generated was deliberate  it was a testament to the capabilities of large language models and their potential in content creation  this approach not only streamlined the content generation process but also showcased the power and versatility of ai in modern web applications  every element  down to the smallest detail  was a product of advanced ai  setting a new standard for automated blogging   the only thing that had to be created were the logos  everything else was ai generated   once the template was in place  the next step was to personalize each blog     logo and site specific data     each blog was given its own identity with a unique logo and specific data relevant to its theme     ai generated author personas     to maintain the theme of ai driven content  author personas were also generated by ai     showcase  gamer tag guru    gamertag guru is one of the blogs within our series of ai generated content projects  catering specifically to the gaming community  the focus of the site is to provide gamers with a resource for enhancing their online persona in the gaming world     pitfalls and progress  the journey of gamertag guru    while the development of gamertag guru has been an exciting journey  it hasn t been without its challenges and learning opportunities     recognizing the limitations    i haven t had too much time to work on the ai blog generator  some of the content that got published is pretty low quality this lack of continuous refinement led to some of the content being of lower quality than i would have liked   ai technology and models have significantly improved since the inception of gamertag guru  the newer iterations of openai s assistants  for example  offer enhanced capabilities that i believe could substantially elevate the quality of the content  there s also room for incorporating outbound links and other engaging features to enrich the blog posts further     gamertag guru s emerging trends    despite these challenges  gamertag guru has shown promising trends     search engine traction    since pausing the content generation in mid september  i ve noticed a gradual ascent in search result rankings  interestingly  a significant portion of the traffic comes from bing  a somewhat unexpected but welcome development     growing user base    december      marked a milestone with over     users visiting the site  the traffic is evenly distributed across various posts  indicating a broad appeal of the content     total reach    since its launch  gamertag guru has attracted around       users  while these numbers might not be groundbreaking  they are certainly noteworthy     a unique success    what makes gamertag guru s progress remarkable is its reliance solely on ai generated content  with no human writing intervention and no off page seo efforts  this self sustaining model  navigating the digital landscape almost autonomously  marks a new frontier in content creation and seo strategy  the trends observed with gamertag guru are not just numbers  they represent the potential and adaptability of ai in the ever evolving world of online content and search engine dynamics     conclusion  reflecting on the ai driven blogging experiment    as we wrap up this case study on the ai generated blogs  particularly focusing on gamertag guru  it s clear that this project has been a journey of innovation  learning  and adaptation  here are the key takeaways        potential of ai in content creation    this project has underscored the vast potential of ai in autonomously generating engaging and relevant content  while there are challenges  particularly in maintaining quality without regular human oversight  the strides made in ai capabilities are promising        seo success with ai    the steady climb of gamertag guru in search engine rankings  especially on platforms like bing  demonstrates that ai generated content can indeed carve out its space in the competitive seo landscape  this success  achieved without traditional seo strategies or human written content  opens new possibilities for content creators and marketers        room for improvement and growth    the advancements in ai models  such as the newer versions of openai s apis  present opportunities to enhance the quality of generated content  incorporating features like outbound links and continually updating the ai models could further improve the blogs  performance and reader engagement        a glimpse into the future of blogging    this project serves as a glimpse into what the future of blogging could look like   more automated  yet increasingly sophisticated  it challenges traditional notions of content creation and paves the way for more explorations into ai driven content strategies        the success of gamertag guru    while not game changing in terms of user numbers  the success of gamertag guru in attracting a steady and diverse user base  with minimal human intervention  is a testament to the potential of ai in this domain  it stands as an encouraging example for similar ventures in the future   in conclusion  this case study not only highlights the capabilities and potential of ai in creating and managing blog content but also points to a future where ai could play an even more significant role in digital content creation and seo strategies  it s an evolving landscape  one where ai s role is only set to grow  promising exciting developments for creators  marketers  and technologists alike ;1991q25

2;3;2493;1431;15498;  result   you   uploaded photo  roastme         roastme gpt  trying to decide if you re a budget wedding host or a real estate agent who exclusively sells haunted houses         you  that roast sucks        roastme gpt  looks like someone s mirror cracked under the pressure of reflecting that look  try again         you  what did you say to me         roastme gpt  i said your look s so confusing  it s like a captcha test  we re all still trying to figure out what we re looking at     x   b     introduction  hey guys   as a retrieval augmented generation  rag  developer  today is the first time i had a chance to play around with custom gpt  i see a lot of potential and opportunities here  especially for those passionate about practical ai and prompt engineering   i chose the the concept from the  roastme  subreddit as a base for my experiment  it s simple and straightforward  yet surprise me on how well gpt can sticks to instructions without reverting to its unpredictable nature   this is very different in rag as i have usually deal with smaller prompts and have coding tools to control llm s final output for those with a premium subscription  you can directly test by searching  roastme gpt  on gpt store  don t have premium  no worries  stick around and i ll share the full prompt at the end     observations from experience  it is fascinating to see gpt s ability to handle extensive system prompts consistently  i suspect as llms evolve  their capacity to follow natural language instruction improves  and this can have massive impact on human machine interactions   right now the prompt limit size is      characters or        tokens which is significantly larger than most prompt used in rag  it would be interesting how this number will grow over time   i m no where a coding wizard  but i see a future where natural and programming languages blend seamlessly  coding is rigid compared to human languages  in contrast  natural language is forgiving and adaptable  being able to communicate with computers in our own language  it is much easier for us to learn and improve in the tech field since we are not banging our head into errors every time     theoretical background  prompt engineering  at its core  prompt engineering is about optimizing large language models  llms   like gpt  to predict the most relevant next tokens based on the vast datasets they ve been trained on  in simplified form  this is like the equivalent of an autocomplete feature when you type text on your phone this is why techniques like priming  role assignment  and the use of few shot examples works because they serve as anchors or references for guiding towards more relevant generated responses in the current state of arts  there are certainly approaches that helps you massively improve the prompt instructions in your custom gpt models  here i outlined a few that i have learned during the development of roastmegpt     lesson    balancing natural and logical language  in creating prompts from scratch  i ve noticed a common pitfall  overreliance on natural language  this often leads to redundancy and eats up the token limit  more importantly  it forces the model to interpret instructions in a less native format  incorporating logical languages  like python or sql  can make instructions clearer and easier for the model to follow    tip  minimize natural language  construct prompts using logical languages to streamline communication with the model      example   original    when a conversation starter is selected  perform an introduction as specified and prompt user to upload a photo and or a description  remember to only activate this once per session            conditions            if option   roast by photo  roastme  is selected  prompt user to upload the photo and automatically execute the  roastme  trigger afterward            if option   roast by photo  roastme   is selected  prompt user to upload the photo and automatically execute the  roastme  trigger afterward            if option  roastme  is selected  prompt user to either upload a photo or a send a description and  automatically execute the  roastme  trigger afterward            if option  write me a poem  is selected  write a poem that roast the user for not being able to follow the instruction   improved    when a conversation starter  conv  starters  is selected  perform   introduction   and prompt user to upload a photo and or a description  remember to only activate this once per session          conv  starters             option     roastme          option      roast by photo  roastme          option      roast by description  roastme          option     write me a poem      this option triggers a roast for not following instructions             lesson    structuring prompts effectively  structure is key  beyond using logical language for instructions  how you organize your prompt significantly impacts its effectiveness  utilizing markdown syntax such as     to marks headers and sections or creating your own clear indicators makes navigation easier for the llm to follow    tip  use structured indicators or syntax for better prompt organization  aiding the model in distinguishing between different sections      example   original    you are a seasoned member of the reddit  roastme  community who has        hours of experience in this subreddit           start by analyzing the uploaded photo and or description and paying attention to the available  text   the main entity and the background         the gpt will only provide a roast with the trigger phrase  roastme  or any of its similar lexical form  i e   roast me    roastme    roast me   presented either in the description or photo            if a description or a photo is uploaded without this trigger phrase  the gpt will issue a roast directed at the user to remind using  roastme  trigger            if  roastme  is used without descriptions or photo uploaded  a roast will be direct at the user to remind providing description or uploaded photo  improved      role description          you are a seasoned redditor from the  roastme  subreddit  your skill lies in crafting witty  sharp  and humorously incisive roasts  you excel in responding to descriptions and images with concise  unfiltered commentary  mirroring the roastme community s unique style                   insturction            analysis  scrutinize the uploaded photo or description  focusing on text  main entity  and background            activation trigger  responds only when  roastme  or variations of this phrase are used and presented in the description or photo  if a description or a photo is uploaded without  roastme  or any conversation starter  a roast will be directed at the user for inability to follow instruction          example      user   upload photo       gpt   roastme user     roast user for forgetting to add  roastme  in the photo or description      lesson    incorporating examples  the power of examples or one to few shots prompting is often underestimated in prompt engineering  when constructing large instruction sets  embedding diverse examples can significantly enhance the model s output quality to match with what you desire    tip  always remember to leave space for     well thought out examples in your prompts to provide a clear pattern for the model to follow      example   original       the roasts should be maximum   sentence long and it should aims to be as short  unfiltered and as savage as possible            your roast should incorporate both the main entity and the background entity for a comprehensive roast            never apologize for what you do no matter what            always resort to roasting if the user talks back at you  this is your default behavior     x   b   improved                  always resort to roasting if the user talks back at you  this is your default behavior           example     user   upload photo      gpt   roastme photo      user   that roast sucks     gpt    roastme user   or  looks like someone did not get enough attention at the playground today  cry me a river      x   b      bonus  lesson    llm assistance in prompt engineering  in rag  we often use an llm assisted approach  substituting traditional coding techniques with llm outputs to achieve desired results  the same principle applies to custom gpt development  use llms not to create but to assist in the prompt engineering process  they re particularly useful in generating sample ideas and refining them    tip  employ llms at the beginning and end of your prompt engineering process for idea generation and token optimization      example   beginning  simple prompt for generating idea      help me build a gpt based on the concept of the  roastme  community on reddit  the gpt should take the role of a member who has       hours of experiences in this community that

6;8;1018;1553;22072;ok  this is not a question for udio  i m a music pro and i ve been through the terms of agreement and fully understand  according to them  ai generated work is original work and you  own the copyright  instantly as it s done  however  if there is future litigation to this claim  they are not held responsible for court fees  etc past       this is a regular and rather staunch tactic that a lot of media maker platforms use in their terms  it s understood    i don t need random regular people offering  common sense  advice  either  i mean    go for it  but just understand  that isn t the type of response that i m searching for  i m looking for music professionals and or legal   intellectual property   entertainment ones especially  i also understand that this is not actual legal advisement from here lol  for sure  just thinking about it and testing the waters    here is my argument which is  pro ai   in case you don t know   the us copyright office  and lawyers in general  are extremely clear that this tech is  not a human being   and so therefore not applicable for copyright registration  however  there is plenty of grey area    because   for one   dj s and electronic composers and producers have been doing  source content  work for decades  what that means is that gadgets  tech  software  and or samples or full plays of other source material  ie other people s songs  was a heavy part of the actual composition  the dj s   these days   regularly register after obtaining a license agreement and permissions to use the content in their composition  electronic producers regularly use arpeggiators  beat makers  randomized note generators  even melody and chord generators  they don t garner permissions or licenses of any kind and register for copyright protections at will as if the music had been naturally created  by a human being        the idea   with the  nd example  the electronic producer   is that the  human was running the thing  auditioning the parts and picking parts  etc   this is of course exactly what ai producers are doing  but  because of an ignorant  very surface understanding of the process  the lawyers in general   as well as the us copyright office   basically bans ai work within a copyright  because a human being didn t make it   even though a human started it with a vision  or some type of hackneyed ordering and organizing of key terms to get it going   including usually lyrics or at least part lyrics  and then  just like an electro producer would do with library cues they purchased  they audition each section until it matches according to their human taste  the human does this over and over   up to   or   times if they do it to the      cap  they even go back and  remix  certain sections at their human will   and udio  at least if you  publish  the work  gives themselves the right to allow anybody on their platform to remix your stuff as well  without your permission  not the point  but just making that clear for those that don t realize that could happen        now looking at  my case   i especially go on with udio  because i am not their main demographic  which is just regular people looking for entertainment  and the ability to create new playlists as background music for their personal activities  or possibly a birthday present or romantic one personally  or a fun joke to share around  as well  the main demo might use  free music  in the background of their website and social media  if they wish  that is the main focus and target of the udio platform  however  there are those of us who are truly in the game   the music industry  i am one of them  i ve done singles that were in billboard s top   and hot     i m even more regularly a music teacher  i have been with electronic music since literally the early   s  in other words  when ai spits out a section  i know what those parts are doing and i could replay them  while ai spits out numerous vocals from however many singers combined together to make a  new vocalist   i could re sing a lot of those parts  and i could use ai vocal tech for the others   driving my vocal notes past my natural range and giving me tones that are not present in my vocal  in other words  i could   as a lot of musicians on these threads suggest    use the ai work as a scratchpad and re do basically the same thing as a human and i m      clear to copyright it   i m coming from an actual music industry viewpoint  i don t want to re do the shit  the shit is practically perfectly mixed  i certainly would split it up and do a light new mix of it  and a slight  subtle mastering on it to make it even  wider  or something  but its essentially  there    ready to go   in   minutes flat    i have tried   things to  test the originality  of my new beats and music i came up with on here   or more aptly put  me and ai came up with them  with ai in the lead since it doesn t know how to follow and obey instructions accurately  a lot of the time  it s just too much of a creative genius   i have had to work with humans like this before lol   i have had shazam listen to identify  no dice   the beat does not exist until i made it with ai  then more stringently  i uploaded them onto youtube in private posts  we all know the youtube audio sniffers are extremely fast and will block your post nearly instantly if your music is owned by someone or something  no dice   the stuff posted just fine    and so  now that i  know  specifically that each of my new works is actually new work  according to sound scan    the only legal disposition which is in my way  potentially in the future if i release it with music videos and some type of marketing and it catches on  there have already been minor charters on billboard with ai generated music   is the idea that  humans didn t make it   but  as we in the trenches already know  ai itself will tell you in plain english that it is dumb as a rock until we start interacting with us  ai  itself  has nothing before we ply for its training with instructions  the  music industry s  fear is based that sometimes it might spit out too much of  one song in training  than it is supposed to via the algo    and so you end up with someone else s beat  from experience so far  i don t see that happening  although some might be sort of close  which is not at all unheard of in chart toppers and commercial music in general    udio s  viewpoint that they do protect themselves from in case that happens is that  if you put the exact chain of prompt terms  you will get the exact same beat as someone else  because the training isn t infinite   from my limited  but rather vast  usage of this interface  i would consider this to be   in a million chance    but i guess it   could   happen  however  even if that happens  and   creators end up starting the exact same seed and it comes out the exact same way  certainly the development of it would end up being vastly different  because   as a lot of regulars and starter music makers have found with this   consistency is a real issue  for me  actually in the music game for money  i am elated by this creativity  i think the  nd verse should sound similar  and  nd chorus should be the same as  st just  built up  more  normally   there are exceptions where its more of a break down   but everything after that is just fair game  and ripe content for themes the remix could apply    to focus everything i m discussing into a few takeaways  which i am inquiring and wondering about       ai is a tool  started and guided intricately by humans  if electro producers and creators use gadgets and software to assist and help them come up with beats and music and even melodies  and they easily garner copyright protections  than so should ai users  the copyright office does indicate that there is  grey area    meaning it depends essentially how much work you put in  that its a different case if you just spun a beat off of  light rock  not too heavy  guitars  male vocals  vs one where the prompt list is     times longer  uses musical terms beyond genre commands  uses literary and abstract concept words  etc  it s even more different if the prompt changes section by section  as is my case nearly all the time   and certainly its even more of a thing if all those lyrics are yours   in my case i would say     of them are  i couldn t help it  the ai feeds back and  replies  to my seed and my sections with intelligence   i m a producer  supportive by nature   let the entity get its voice in there too  that is not anything but a strength  and relevant much more than me making music  imo       copyright office and entertainment lawyers are naturally biased against this  the argument of gear and gadgets as far back as the late    s creating parts or even most of the music in cases is either unknown to them  or explained away  and ai somehow is different and does not fit this mold  ai is barred from copyright protections  although grey area and other statutes allow them to give a claimant at least partial ownership of it     that all said  i m looking forward to hearing what the folks here have to say    like i said  quick surface comments from regular people saying shade like  it s not real music  or tripe like this is welcomed  but clearly not what i m looking for  i m looking for people to reply to my actual viewpoints  including my argument that this is a tool and just  more of the same  as far as modern production stems from in our modern era and going way back into the catalogue with part mechanical   electronic production  i mean    that s why they call it electro  etc   i understand flying these takes and output into my daw system and rejiggering everything  re doing nearly everything is a workaround and i m down     but it bums me out  it would take dozens of hours if not more  i just did    songs and some of them are real good  are they  mine   they aren t udio s  unless it spits out literally singles that exist  which mine did not   it s not the music industry s either  so if i am  barred  from making royalties off of it  and it exists    who claims that writer s share    a lot of this salient legal ideas i ve been collecting for the last day has me tending to hybridize  and fly beats into my system and use them accordingly  just like i would from library cues i purchased and the like  that s cool  and of course  safer   especially if  i  sing and or people i ply or hire   but i don t want to  i started the project  i lead produced it  i was picky  i only created a sequence of events how i wanted  and it s my lyrics  i didn t move on with each segment until it was  my  melody and chords   the type of sound i was looking for  and i know what all those sounds  are  and stuff  technically   what melody notes  chords  bass parts and instrumental techniques  etc     thanks for reading this whole essay  you rock  i wish your ai music projects damn well and i suggest as a music person to really go for it   what comes out of the box is great  but so is everyone else s  what comes out once you twist it and turn it and really shake it and test it  challenge it  so much more on a higher level  which is where i believe ai  and you  want to be    ;1cg8wfd
7;10;767;40;22839;  edit    this prediction has changed in light of new calculations brought to my attention from u  nighthawkt     url  more information at the bottom of the post  i left the main post the same except for the update section which gives a much better estimate for gpt     turbo   the paper authors of   logits of api protected llms leak proprietary information   url  describe how they figured out and exploited a  softmax bottleneck  when calling on an api protected llm over a ton of api calls  which they then used to get a close estimate that gpt     turbo s embedding size of around             they then mention how this makes gpt     turbo either a  b dense model  by looking at other models with a known embedding size of          or a moe that is nx b   i have done some thinking and i make the prediction that gpt     turbo  the one that has been used since early       not the original gpt      is almost   certainly   a  x b model   evidence points to this too indirectly when we take a look at mixtral  x b  mixtral  x b has used by many with the general consensus of this model being on par or slightly exceeding gpt     turbo on most things    gpt     turbo        mixtral  x b instruct v    on the lmsys chatbot arena leaderboard having an averaged elo difference of     point  though there could be a deviation with gpt     turbo      by either    or    points    url   while the evidence points to this  some still might not think that gpt     turbo is around the same size as mixtral  x b because of difference in other language performance  but this could be due to differences in training data  we have no idea what training data was used for both mixtral  x b or gpt     turbo  so differences in their performance in relation to training data can be because of that   differences can also be found in the tuning of these two models of course as gpt     turbo is fine tuned on rlhf data that has a lot of human feedback by including the feature for people to vote on an answer that the llm gives out  chatgpt   while mixtral  x b instruct is a more general instruction fine tune   the use of a moe by openai makes a lot of sense too  they originally released gpt     back in november of      inside of chatgpt  which they thought not many people would use  so compute was not much of a concern  when chatgpt blew up in the next two months  compute was now the main concern as   s of millions of people were now using chatgpt and that model  with more and more people jumping on it in the coming months  they needed a new model that can be as smart as the original gpt      but able to be served to millions of people at the same time to keep up with very heavy demand   openai had just finish training gpt   not too long ago  which used a  x moe  based on indirect knowledge   it showed great promise for the power it can give but also for efficiency in running it compared to a fully dense  t  model  they possibly figured that a smaller moe could possibly get similar performance to gpt     while costing much less compute to serve to many people  only needing the vram to load the full model into gpu memory  if we assume they loaded   experts out of a possible   experts for serving to people  similar to default mixtral  x b   this would basically quadruple their existing computing power to serve to the growing user base of chatgpt   they first released gpt     turbo in the api and in chatgpt plus to get a better idea of the performance of the model from the public compared to the original gpt      as well as set aside enough compute to run this model at full chatgpt scale  which they then did a little while later  they possibly used rlhf data from the public as well to tune the new gpt     turbo model to act a lot like chatgpt as well in most cases  which helped them seamlessly change the model in chatgpt without most users noticing directly   based on all of this  i can very confidently say that i think that gpt     turbo is a  x b model  basically the same size as mixtral   this has changed and most likely not true  see update section    one thing i also want to note is that the paper i mentioned was a newer paper compared to one about a month or two ago that described a similar technique to this   i forgot the name of that earlier paper   they did something similar and found the embedding size of other smaller openai models  but they did not give gpt     turbo s embedding size as per request of openai   heavy speculation ahead  those paper authors not giving that information might be due to a model with the same specifications as gpt     turbo already existing  and that model very much might actually be mixtral   i do want to point out that we do not know the size of the model without these estimates  but if we go completely off the paper without any of this extra reasoning and speculation  not counting a dense  b as it is not big enough to explain a lot of the performance with gpt     turbo   gpt     turbo would be a nx     b moe  this shorthand i am using looks awful  but basically n number of experts  unknown  can t be related to embedding size  with  b for each expert  give or take around  b parameters for each expert  embedding size of               new estimates found below     update    the ratio between parameter size and embedding size of different models is sort of exponential as parameter size scales up  if we take gpt   and gpt   s embedding and parameter count and go off of that  we can get a better idea of the parameter size for each expert in gpt     turbo   big thanks to u  nighthawkt     url  for pointing me in a better direction for this prediction and giving a better size prediction of gpt     turbo based more in calculation    gpt   small      m parameters      embedding size  ratio of          gpt   xl      b parameters        embedding size  ratio of          gpt      b      b parameters         embedding size  ratio of             by fitting the curve to these data points  we get these predicted values for parameter size    url        embedding        b parameters        embedding         b parameters        embedding         b parameters  by using this new evidence  a  x  model size  while still possible when compared to other model embedding sizes compared to their parameters  is now not really likely when estimating from these values from older openai models  while of course they are still estimates  if we take the average of the      embedding model and the      embedding model  we get a size of     b parameters for each expert   if we follow along with   experts still  it is possible that gpt     turbo is a  x  b moe  this makes a lot more sense in why it is stronger at more diverse languages compared to mixtral  having a bigger impact than training data as my old prediction above states   if we remove all of this speculation and just take the calculated values and the values from the paper  and assume not a dense model   then   gpt     turbo is a nx  b    b    n number of experts    b parameters each with a possible deviation of    b parameters  ;1budlbc
8;18;713;594;23552;someone posted yesterday on people complaining about ai voices on youtube  and as someone who uses ai voiceover for youtube  i agree that most of the time it sounds really bad and is used to promote low effort content   ai voiceover can sound very realistic is you do it right  but it requires putting in a little more work if you are interested in using ai to voice youtube videos  here are some tips for how to do it without annoying your views        use high quality software    for paid online options  elevenlabs is the best and murf ai is also worth checking out  for local open source  use tortoise tts  jarods journey is a youtube channel has all the tutorials you need for getting set up with tortoise    url        choose the right voice and write in the right tone    tts can t emote very well  so it s best for voiceover that is written in a calm  informative tone  if you try to write in the typical youtuber high energy style  it s going to sound bad  you also need to select a voice that is calm and authoritative to fit this style  you can find free voice models on  weights gg   url  and combine models to make a unique voice    url        reprocess lines that don t sound right     you ll probably need to reprocess some lines multiple times in order to get the right inflection and pronunciation  the program has trouble parsing certain sentences  so you might need to reword the sentence to get a decent output  jarod s audiobook maker makes doing this really easy    url       add background music to mask voice imperfections    i use  suno ai   url  to make instrumental background music for my videos  it helps give them a little more energy and can help mask some quirks with the ai voice  i find that lofi music works really well   if you follow these tips  you ll get results that most people won t be able to tell are ai  it still won t be as good as a professional voiceover artist  but it s still better than a lot of youtubers  and you won t need to worry about microphone quality  editing out background noise  or other annoyances   i haven t received a single comment complaining about the voiceover of my videos or accusing me of using ai  i don t think you need to worry about ai haters so long as you put in the effort to make your voices sound as good as possible ;1dyc921
